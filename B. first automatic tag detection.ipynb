      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 29-year-old, mentally retarded female with seizures since age 7, after removal of an occipital tumor.  Last seizure one week ago. MEDICATIONS: Dilantin. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and light sleep record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with theta activity and disorganized.  A rare, slow alpha rhythm of 7 Hz, 20 V is seen. Low voltage, frontocentral beta activity is also seen.  Soon after the EEG starts, bursts of 2 to 4 Hz frontally predominant sharp and slow wave complexes lasting for one to two seconds are seen.  In addition, frequent right focal spike and wave complexes are seen in the right hemisphere, mostly in the temporal region, but also in the occipital area.  This focal spike and wave activity occasionally generalized. Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in the amplitude as well as a mixed frequency of activity, with bursts of frontally predominant 2 to 3 Hz sharp and slow wave activity. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  When the patient is aroused, she has some spastic facial movements, but no EEG correlates were recorded. HR:  78 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Diffusely slow and disorganized background. Bursts of frontally predominant sharp and slow wave activity. Focal spike and wave activity in the right temporal and occipital area. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is consistent with a diffuse disorder of cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter.  The epileptiform discharges found in the right hemisphere, as well as the frontally predominant sharp and slow waves supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient. This EEG pattern is usually seen in patients with refractory epilepsy.  The clinical differential should also include Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.'"

Seizures characterized by generalized shaking lasting 20 seconds. MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Tegretol, Tranxene, and many others. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy or somnolent. Photic stimulation is performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and is primarily a mixture of rhythmic 3 Hz activity with smaller amounts of 2 Hz activity and some 4 to 5 Hz theta.  There are multifocal spike and slow wave complexes identified in the record including bifrontal, high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes with an approximately 2 Hz after going slow wave.  Focal epileptiform activity is also seen in the occipital regions, sometimes maximum at O2 and at other times with a poly spike wave component at O1-O2.  The epileptiform activity may be seen independently in the right or left hemisphere including T5, FP1, F7, and C3. The patient is noted to snore occasionally, but there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a significant difference in terms of awake or asleep pattern, although there may be more frontally predominant delta in drowsiness.  There are occasional high amplitude, bifrontal poly spike and slow wave complexes. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. There are some shifting asymmetries in terms of the amount of theta or delta seen in the background. HR:  78 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Generalized slowing. Slow spike and wave activity. Multifocal spikes. CLINICAL CORRELATION: For this individual who had a childhood history of infantile spasms, the pattern described is compatible with a Lennox-Gastaut-type syndrome and/or a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.'"

Patient is admitted to continuous audio-video EEG monitoring for event characterization and potential seizure localization and  lateralization as a part of presurgical evaluation for potential epilepsy surgery. Seizure semiology: Type 1: No Aura. Head shaking side-to-side.  Stares blankly, loss of awareness, does not respond to stimuli during the event. Lasts about 1O min, occasionally eyes roll backwards. Type 2: Type 1with shaking of the arms and legs associated with the staring for about 2 min. Post event confusion for 30min. Admission  Medications: Lamictal 200 mg BID Zonisamide 300 mg qHS Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Additionally, T1, F9, T9, P9, T2, F10,T10, and P1O electrodes were placed in this patient. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.  A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing. During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance . The Getman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named \"Stellate\") was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.  Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.  All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed male with encephalitis and recurrent seizures. MEDICATIONS: Lacosamide, dilantin, Ativan, Klonopin INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. As this section of the records begins, the patient reports \"he is feeling great\" as if he is not having more seizures. Then subsequently he has 2 events that he describes as auras, which are seizures with impairment of awareness. He does have occasional myoclonic jerks. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the 24-hour period includes more of the rhythmic repetitive slowing than noted at other times. Isolated high amplitude right hemispheric spike and wave activity is observed. Push button times include 5:20 which includes actually a seizure. Although the patient describes this as an aura, it is really a focal motor seizure with loss of axial tone and stiffening of the right leg. The patient seems to know that it is coming at 10:20:40 before he pushes the button and he seems to be a little bit confused. Unfortunately, he is moving about and there is muscle and movement artifact until he has loss of axial tone and stiffening on the right at 10:20:56. Characteristic tonic clonic activity obscures the EEG and although he is most jerking on the right, it seems to obscure the entire EEG. By 10:23:00 it seems to be over. The patient is back in bed and responsive to the nurses, helping them with the blood pressure cuff by 10:24. Seizure time 13:30. The patient is sitting in a chair. He puts his left hand to his nose at 13:29, but does not seem to be uncomfortable. For this seizure, the dad seems to know what is going on and pushes the button at 13:30, even before there is much that seems to be going on with the patient. The patient seems to be fine at 13:30:05, moving about. Additional sharp waves are noted at 13:34. This EEG monitor ends at 15:35 and at that time there is prominent sharp waves and rhythmic slowing. IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring was remarkable for: 1. High amplitude sharp waves and spikes in the left hemisphere, particularly parietal occipital region. 2. Some things which the patient describes as \"auras\" which are in the borderline between simple and complex partial seizures, which are associated with more rhythmic mixed theta delta. 3. A third seizure type, which seemed to be a focal motor seizure. 4. That same rhythmic discharge which was not always associated with change in awareness. CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEG monitoring and support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.'"

MEDICATIONS: Lacosamide, dilantin, Ativan, Klonopin INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. As this section of the records begins, the patient reports \"he is feeling great\" as if he is not having more seizures. Then subsequently he has 2 events that he describes as auras, which are seizures with impairment of awareness. He does have occasional myoclonic jerks. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the 24-hour period includes more of the rhythmic repetitive slowing than noted at other times. Isolated high amplitude right hemispheric spike and wave activity is observed. Push button times include 5:20 which includes actually a seizure. Although the patient describes this as an aura, it is really a focal motor seizure with loss of axial tone and stiffening of the right leg. The patient seems to know that it is coming at 10:20:40 before he pushes the button and he seems to be a little bit confused. Unfortunately, he is moving about and there is muscle and movement artifact until he has loss of axial tone and stiffening on the right at 10:20:56. Characteristic tonic clonic activity obscures the EEG and although he is most jerking on the right, it seems to obscure the entire EEG. By 10:23:00 it seems to be over. The patient is back in bed and responsive to the nurses, helping them with the blood pressure cuff by 10:24. Seizure time 13:30. The patient is sitting in a chair. He puts his left hand to his nose at 13:29, but does not seem to be uncomfortable. For this seizure, the dad seems to know what is going on and pushes the button at 13:30, even before there is much that seems to be going on with the patient. The patient seems to be fine at 13:30:05, moving about. Additional sharp waves are noted at 13:34. This EEG monitor ends at 15:35 and at that time there is prominent sharp waves and rhythmic slowing. IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring was remarkable for: 1. High amplitude sharp waves and spikes in the left hemisphere, particularly parietal occipital region. 2. Some things which the patient describes as \"auras\" which are in the borderline between simple and complex partial seizures, which are associated with more rhythmic mixed theta delta. 3. A third seizure type, which seemed to be a focal motor seizure. 4. That same rhythmic discharge which was not always associated with change in awareness. CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEG monitoring and support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.'"

The patient is febrile and poorly responsive. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall pattern is a mixture of theta and delta. The previously described asymmetry is not as prominent in terms of disruption of activity from the right hemisphere. There are frontally predominant triphasic waves which are asymmetric, left more so than right. There are also left temporal and frontal sharp waves noted intermittently. They have a periodic nature to them but do not evolve. On occasion they occur with bursts or trains. In addition, the patient also has behaviors where he lifts his right hand, shakes it rapidly for a second or two, and then puts it down. These do not carry an EEG signature. In addition, the hand movements are in two planes. The technologist tests the patient for responsiveness but had difficulty determining whether or not there is a change or evidence of interactivity. At least on one occasional there seems to be a bit more theta with auditory stimulation. HR: 114 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Generalized background slowing and disorganization. 2. Frontally predominant triphasic waves. 3. Left frontotemporal sharp waves and frontocentral sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance. The triphasic wave may be part of a metabolic encephalopathy. The sharp waves on the left are of concern in this individual with a previous left MCA infarct. The episodes of hand tremor do not appear to carry an EEG signature. In this critically ill individual with epileptiform activity, the hand movements are unusual for ictal type behavior and were evidence of responsiveness to the technician.'"

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lamotrigine, Digoxin, Zocor, Flomax, Citalopram, ASA, Risperidone, Miralax, Protonix, Baclofen, Seroquel, Aldactone, Midodrine, Vancomycin, Lasix, Dobutamine INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is febrile and poorly responsive. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall pattern is a mixture of theta and delta. The previously described asymmetry is not as prominent in terms of disruption of activity from the right hemisphere. There are frontally predominant triphasic waves which are asymmetric, left more so than right. There are also left temporal and frontal sharp waves noted intermittently. They have a periodic nature to them but do not evolve. On occasion they occur with bursts or trains. In addition, the patient also has behaviors where he lifts his right hand, shakes it rapidly for a second or two, and then puts it down. These do not carry an EEG signature. In addition, the hand movements are in two planes. The technologist tests the patient for responsiveness but had difficulty determining whether or not there is a change or evidence of interactivity. At least on one occasional there seems to be a bit more theta with auditory stimulation. HR: 114 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Generalized background slowing and disorganization. 2. Frontally predominant triphasic waves. 3. Left frontotemporal sharp waves and frontocentral sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance. The triphasic wave may be part of a metabolic encephalopathy. The sharp waves on the left are of concern in this individual with a previous left MCA infarct. The episodes of hand tremor do not appear to carry an EEG signature. In this critically ill individual with epileptiform activity, the hand movements are unusual for ictal type behavior and were evidence of responsiveness to the technician.'"
