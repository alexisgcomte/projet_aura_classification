Seizures characterized by generalized shaking lasting 20 seconds. MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Tegretol, Tranxene, and many others. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy or somnolent. Photic stimulation is performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and is primarily a mixture of rhythmic 3 Hz activity with smaller amounts of 2 Hz activity and some 4 to 5 Hz theta.  There are multifocal spike and slow wave complexes identified in the record including bifrontal, high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes with an approximately 2 Hz after going slow wave.  Focal epileptiform activity is also seen in the occipital regions, sometimes maximum at O2 and at other times with a poly spike wave component at O1-O2.  The epileptiform activity may be seen independently in the right or left hemisphere including T5, FP1, F7, and C3. The patient is noted to snore occasionally, but there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a significant difference in terms of awake or asleep pattern, although there may be more frontally predominant delta in drowsiness.  There are occasional high amplitude, bifrontal poly spike and slow wave complexes. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. There are some shifting asymmetries in terms of the amount of theta or delta seen in the background. HR:  78 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Generalized slowing. Slow spike and wave activity. Multifocal spikes. CLINICAL CORRELATION: For this individual who had a childhood history of infantile spasms, the pattern described is compatible with a Lennox-Gastaut-type syndrome and/or a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.'"

MEDICATIONS: Lacosamide, dilantin, Ativan, Klonopin INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. As this section of the records begins, the patient reports \"he is feeling great\" as if he is not having more seizures. Then subsequently he has 2 events that he describes as auras, which are seizures with impairment of awareness. He does have occasional myoclonic jerks. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the 24-hour period includes more of the rhythmic repetitive slowing than noted at other times. Isolated high amplitude right hemispheric spike and wave activity is observed. Push button times include 5:20 which includes actually a seizure. Although the patient describes this as an aura, it is really a focal motor seizure with loss of axial tone and stiffening of the right leg. The patient seems to know that it is coming at 10:20:40 before he pushes the button and he seems to be a little bit confused. Unfortunately, he is moving about and there is muscle and movement artifact until he has loss of axial tone and stiffening on the right at 10:20:56. Characteristic tonic clonic activity obscures the EEG and although he is most jerking on the right, it seems to obscure the entire EEG. By 10:23:00 it seems to be over. The patient is back in bed and responsive to the nurses, helping them with the blood pressure cuff by 10:24. Seizure time 13:30. The patient is sitting in a chair. He puts his left hand to his nose at 13:29, but does not seem to be uncomfortable. For this seizure, the dad seems to know what is going on and pushes the button at 13:30, even before there is much that seems to be going on with the patient. The patient seems to be fine at 13:30:05, moving about. Additional sharp waves are noted at 13:34. This EEG monitor ends at 15:35 and at that time there is prominent sharp waves and rhythmic slowing. IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring was remarkable for: 1. High amplitude sharp waves and spikes in the left hemisphere, particularly parietal occipital region. 2. Some things which the patient describes as \"auras\" which are in the borderline between simple and complex partial seizures, which are associated with more rhythmic mixed theta delta. 3. A third seizure type, which seemed to be a focal motor seizure. 4. That same rhythmic discharge which was not always associated with change in awareness. CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEG monitoring and support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.'"

      "text/plain": "\" CLINICAL HISTORY:  Rasmussen's encephalitis with breakthrough seizures. MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, IVIG, phenobarbital, Klonopin, others. INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit.  During a section of the record, the patient has approximately 40 simple partial seizures, all characterized by involuntary movements on the right.  Other seizures can occur out of sleep, but in this 24-hour section almost all the seizures seem to wake him up and are associated with right-sided shaking. The seizures have variable patterns, but all localize to the left hemisphere.  Some seem to start with a beta buzz in the left central region, others with more higher amplitude spike and wave activity.  The interictal activity includes a pattern with excess beta and theta from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere demonstrates __________ delta and the epileptiform activity interictally is more of a polyspike activity in the left posterior temporal region or central parietal region. Heart rate 80 bpm. There is no impression or clinical correlation because there are more days to dictate.\""

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep, in wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude left posterior temporal spike complex. Clinical seizures are noted reliably with the patient and nurse and there are more than 20 pushbutton events, approximately 23, all 30-60 seconds in duration.  They are characterized by focal motor activity on the right hemibody.  Electrocardiographically, there is a buzz of mixed 5 and 10 Hz activity in the left hemisphere including the central regions.   There are a handful of seizures that when seizures occur as pairs where there is a bit more of a rhythmic delta pattern that precedes it.  So, if there are 2 seizures together, the second is not as well defined as the first.  Many of the seizures occur in sleep.  Some seem to have a beta buzz early on in the seizure. Heart rate 80 BPM. IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour section of EEG monitoring was remarkable for a large number of seizures.  The most disturbing seem to be have been those that occurred in sleep, but in fact, they were also seen in the early evening hours as well.  There may have been other events that looked like seizures, but were not associated with a pushbutton event and those occurred with the patient off camera, so it is difficult to know if these were clinically significant or not.  Of note, there are other sections in the record where the patient seems to have had seizures while sleeping which did not seem to disrupt his sleep at all.'"

MEDICATIONS:  Decadron, phenobarbital, lacosamide, Zocor, others. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was not experiencing involuntary movements during the EEG.  So this is a technically satisfactory EEG with acceptable impedances, but the craniotomy defect was noted. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal and demonstrates an asymmetry.  The right hemisphere is moderately slow with primarily a theta frequency background noted in wakefulness.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more significant arrhythmic delta activity particularly in the left posterior quadrant.  A high amplitude epileptiform discharge, high amplitude spike and slow wave complex is noted.  This demonstrates variable maximum and includes T5, T3, P3 __________.  Some waveforms differ substantially than others in their distribution.  At some point, using an average reference, the reference appears to be the most active focus.  The left posterior temporal or parietal region is the most active area of epileptiform activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation:  Did appear to accentuate the epileptiform activity. Heart rate 72 bpm. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Very prominent epileptiform discharge in the left posterior quadrant. Focal slowing with arrhythmic delta activity throughout the left hemisphere, most prominent in the left posterior temporal region. Marked __________ and slowing on the right. Questionable activation of the epileptiform activity on the left with photic stimulation. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic focus in the left hemisphere.  The previous craniotomy may accentuate the amplitude of the activity described above.  For this individual, with complex epileptiform activity, today, the activity is on the left rather than bilateral.\""

MEDICATIONS: \\tDilantin, Depakote, phenobarbital, insulin, digoxin, Lopressor. INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. During the record, including on the 26th, the Phenobarbital was turned off. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial data on the 24th there are intermittent seizures occurring in the contexts of burst suppression. There are prolonged periods of suppression with brief seizures. However, by 16:28 the EEG is completely suppressed. This section of the record was previously dictated. Additional recording after 16:37 for the following subsequent days includes the following: October 24 to October 25: A suppressed EEG. The patient can be visualized in the unit. Technologist and nurses work with her. The background EEG remains markedly suppressed. October 25 to October 26: Again no definite cerebral activity is observed. The overall activity is very low voltage. Electrode artifacts and other artifacts are observed. There is no variability in the record, although there is some EKG artifact. October 26 to October 27: Background EEG continues to demonstrate an essentially suppressed pattern. There is some artifact picked up in the background. With the use of alternative montages the overall activity appears to be essentially artifactual. CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 82-year-old female with a history of a right frontal craniotomy for tumor, now in status. MEDICATIONS:  Multiple anesthetic medication, including Propofol, Dilantin INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG performed using standard 10-20 Hz electrode placement with l channel EKG. Study from 2253 on October 23, 2008 through October 24, 2008 at 1043. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Due to continuous right frontal sharp waves patient is put higher in a pentobarbital coma. There seems to be more bursts of right frontal sharp waves consistent with the status, but there are some seen as well on the left. Pentobarbital is started at 125. At that time an intermittent suppression pattern is seen. Periods of bursts will go from 30 seconds to 1 minute and 40 seconds. When there is a return of the burst the patient is seen to reenter a status pattern of right frontal greater than left sharp waves, which can last for 20 seconds before there is return of suppression. As the records continues you have longer periods of suppression, but as soon as the patient returns to a burst pattern, again you see the nonconvulsive status pattern of the right predominantly frontal discharges. On the right there is definitely extension of these discharges throughout the hemisphere. A heart rate 60 beats per minute. IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 1.\\tPharmacological burst suppression pattern. 2. Bursts of continuous sharp waves seen, right greater than left. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record is consistent with continuous status throughout the pharmacological burst suppression pattern.'"

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel in EKG.  The patient was poorly cooperative throughout the record.  Occasional muscle twitch artifact was noted. DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG was diffusely slow with a lower voltage beta and theta pattern.  The normal milestones of an awake adult EEG were not identified.\n\n CLINICAL HISTORY: MEDICATIONS: INTRODUCTION:  This is a continuation of the day 3 and 4 report on this patient for the dates 03/14/2012 to 03/16/2012. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Day 3:  At the onset of day 3, there is frequent rhythmic runs of sharp waves seen at F7, T1 and at times at T5 that appear to come and go but have no clear evolution.  However, on 03/15 in the morning at 9:30 a.m., the patient appears to suddenly stop talking on the phone, put herself on the side of her left chest and started rubbing her shirt with her right hand.  The nurses at the bedside started asking her questions, and she could not answer.  Then she started staring at the nurse and exhibiting mouth movements while she continued to rub her chest with her hand.  Afterwards, about 20 seconds later, she started rubbing her chest with her left hand and continued to __________with the left hand.  This continues until the seizure and the left hand movement stops seconds later, and then she just stares and remains unresponsive.  This behavior then stops as the seizure stops.  About 2 minutes and 40 seconds after the seizure, the behavior stops and the seizure ends.  During this time, the EEG reveals at about almost 50 seconds after the clinical onset of the seizure there appears to be an evolving T5 discharge which then appears to increase in frequency from 2 to 4 Hz to 6 Hz and moves more anteriorly, then slowing down before stopping at the end of the seizure.  End of day 3. Day 4:  During day 4, there are multiple nonconvulsive seizures.  The first one is seen at 6:30 p.m. lasting about 4 minutes where the patient is lying in bed and appears to exhibit no movements.  Meanwhile, there is a rhythmic discharge in the left anterior temporal region at F7-T1 that increases and slows down in rhythmicity but continues throughout the recording, at times with larger and smaller superimposed sharp waves.  The next nonconvulsive electrical seizure occurred at 11:31 p.m.  This one appears to begin at T5 and appears to slowly evolve and move more anteriorly to F7-T1.  During it, the patient appears to move but does not clearly appear to exhibit a clinical correlate.  The event ends about 1 minute and 50 seconds later.  End of seizures day 4. IMPRESSION:\n\n CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizures day 2. MEDICATIONS: INTRODUCTION:  On the recording there were 3 nonclinical seizures detected.  Incidentally, open review of the study the first one occurred at 1:27:42 p.m.  The patient laying in bed listening to the phone and there was no clinical correlate.  There is nice rhythmic delta proceeding to theta of 71 discharge which appears to increase in frequency and end in about 30 seconds.  At 1:30:52 p.m. another similar electrocardiographic seizure occurs for about 40 seconds.  However, the evolution of this one is not as nice as the first one.  At about 6:31 p.m. he has another rhythmic discharge which appears to start in the 2 Hz range, increasing to 5 Hz rhythmically at F7, T1 and again with no clinical correlate, the patient appears to be watching television during this last event.  No other events were recorded during the second 20 hours of day 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: IMPRESSION:  The rest of the impression and the correlation will be added at the end of this report.\n\n"
