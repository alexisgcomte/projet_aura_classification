Seizures characterized by generalized shaking lasting 20 seconds. MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Tegretol, Tranxene, and many others. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy or somnolent. Photic stimulation is performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and is primarily a mixture of rhythmic 3 Hz activity with smaller amounts of 2 Hz activity and some 4 to 5 Hz theta.  There are multifocal spike and slow wave complexes identified in the record including bifrontal, high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes with an approximately 2 Hz after going slow wave.  Focal epileptiform activity is also seen in the occipital regions, sometimes maximum at O2 and at other times with a poly spike wave component at O1-O2.  The epileptiform activity may be seen independently in the right or left hemisphere including T5, FP1, F7, and C3. The patient is noted to snore occasionally, but there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a significant difference in terms of awake or asleep pattern, although there may be more frontally predominant delta in drowsiness.  There are occasional high amplitude, bifrontal poly spike and slow wave complexes. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. There are some shifting asymmetries in terms of the amount of theta or delta seen in the background. HR:  78 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Generalized slowing. Slow spike and wave activity. Multifocal spikes. CLINICAL CORRELATION: For this individual who had a childhood history of infantile spasms, the pattern described is compatible with a Lennox-Gastaut-type syndrome and/or a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.'"

MEDICATIONS: Lacosamide, dilantin, Ativan, Klonopin INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. As this section of the records begins, the patient reports \"he is feeling great\" as if he is not having more seizures. Then subsequently he has 2 events that he describes as auras, which are seizures with impairment of awareness. He does have occasional myoclonic jerks. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the 24-hour period includes more of the rhythmic repetitive slowing than noted at other times. Isolated high amplitude right hemispheric spike and wave activity is observed. Push button times include 5:20 which includes actually a seizure. Although the patient describes this as an aura, it is really a focal motor seizure with loss of axial tone and stiffening of the right leg. The patient seems to know that it is coming at 10:20:40 before he pushes the button and he seems to be a little bit confused. Unfortunately, he is moving about and there is muscle and movement artifact until he has loss of axial tone and stiffening on the right at 10:20:56. Characteristic tonic clonic activity obscures the EEG and although he is most jerking on the right, it seems to obscure the entire EEG. By 10:23:00 it seems to be over. The patient is back in bed and responsive to the nurses, helping them with the blood pressure cuff by 10:24. Seizure time 13:30. The patient is sitting in a chair. He puts his left hand to his nose at 13:29, but does not seem to be uncomfortable. For this seizure, the dad seems to know what is going on and pushes the button at 13:30, even before there is much that seems to be going on with the patient. The patient seems to be fine at 13:30:05, moving about. Additional sharp waves are noted at 13:34. This EEG monitor ends at 15:35 and at that time there is prominent sharp waves and rhythmic slowing. IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring was remarkable for: 1. High amplitude sharp waves and spikes in the left hemisphere, particularly parietal occipital region. 2. Some things which the patient describes as \"auras\" which are in the borderline between simple and complex partial seizures, which are associated with more rhythmic mixed theta delta. 3. A third seizure type, which seemed to be a focal motor seizure. 4. That same rhythmic discharge which was not always associated with change in awareness. CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEG monitoring and support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.'"

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit.  During a section of the record, the patient has approximately 40 simple partial seizures, all characterized by involuntary movements on the right.  Other seizures can occur out of sleep, but in this 24-hour section almost all the seizures seem to wake him up and are associated with right-sided shaking. The seizures have variable patterns, but all localize to the left hemisphere.  Some seem to start with a beta buzz in the left central region, others with more higher amplitude spike and wave activity.  The interictal activity includes a pattern with excess beta and theta from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere demonstrates __________ delta and the epileptiform activity interictally is more of a polyspike activity in the left posterior temporal region or central parietal region. Heart rate 80 bpm. There is no impression or clinical correlation because there are more days to dictate.\""

MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Lacosamide, Phenobarbital, Klonopin, Lipitor, Pantoprazole, Lisinopril INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  As the record begins, the activity includes a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry.  It is medium amplitude, but slow, primarily theta on the right with some occasional posterior delta.  From there left there is clearly a breach with a high amplitude spike and slow-wave complex at T3 and T5.  It is also picked up at C3/P3. The first seizure occurs within 1 minute with a burst of 14 Hz activity emanating from the left frontal region with frequency evolution.  This is over 4 minutes and 35 seconds into the EEG.  Additional seizure occurs at 4 minutes and 40 seconds, and another similar seizure with the fast activity from the left frontal region at 3 Hz photic stimulation.  In that seizure, focal spiking is noted at T5.  Photic stimulation does not otherwise activate the record. HR:    90 bpm IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Focal slowing to the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity. Modest slowing from the right. Epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere which may be centrotemporal, left hemispheric, or left posterior temple. Unusual seizure pattern which seems to start with 14 Hz activity from the frontal and frontotemporal regions on the left but ends with a posterior temporal spike. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is not substantially different from previous EEG monitoring sessions for this individual, although these seizures are exquisitely focal.  Additional EEG monitoring will be initiated as pharmacotherapy is implemented.'"

MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Lacosamide, Phenobarbital, Klonopin, Lipitor, Pantoprazole, Lisinopril INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  As the record begins, the activity includes a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry.  It is medium amplitude, but slow, primarily theta on the right with some occasional posterior delta.  From there left there is clearly a breach with a high amplitude spike and slow-wave complex at T3 and T5.  It is also picked up at C3/P3. The first seizure occurs within 1 minute with a burst of 14 Hz activity emanating from the left frontal region with frequency evolution.  This is over 4 minutes and 35 seconds into the EEG.  Additional seizure occurs at 4 minutes and 40 seconds, and another similar seizure with the fast activity from the left frontal region at 3 Hz photic stimulation.  In that seizure, focal spiking is noted at T5.  Photic stimulation does not otherwise activate the record. HR:    90 bpm IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Focal slowing to the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity. Modest slowing from the right. Epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere which may be centrotemporal, left hemispheric, or left posterior temple. Unusual seizure pattern which seems to start with 14 Hz activity from the frontal and frontotemporal regions on the left but ends with a posterior temporal spike. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is not substantially different from previous EEG monitoring sessions for this individual, although these seizures are exquisitely focal.  Additional EEG monitoring will be initiated as pharmacotherapy is implemented.'"

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep, in wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude left posterior temporal spike complex. Clinical seizures are noted reliably with the patient and nurse and there are more than 20 pushbutton events, approximately 23, all 30-60 seconds in duration.  They are characterized by focal motor activity on the right hemibody.  Electrocardiographically, there is a buzz of mixed 5 and 10 Hz activity in the left hemisphere including the central regions.   There are a handful of seizures that when seizures occur as pairs where there is a bit more of a rhythmic delta pattern that precedes it.  So, if there are 2 seizures together, the second is not as well defined as the first.  Many of the seizures occur in sleep.  Some seem to have a beta buzz early on in the seizure. Heart rate 80 BPM. IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour section of EEG monitoring was remarkable for a large number of seizures.  The most disturbing seem to be have been those that occurred in sleep, but in fact, they were also seen in the early evening hours as well.  There may have been other events that looked like seizures, but were not associated with a pushbutton event and those occurred with the patient off camera, so it is difficult to know if these were clinically significant or not.  Of note, there are other sections in the record where the patient seems to have had seizures while sleeping which did not seem to disrupt his sleep at all.'"

MEDICATIONS:  Decadron, phenobarbital, lacosamide, Zocor, others. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was not experiencing involuntary movements during the EEG.  So this is a technically satisfactory EEG with acceptable impedances, but the craniotomy defect was noted. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal and demonstrates an asymmetry.  The right hemisphere is moderately slow with primarily a theta frequency background noted in wakefulness.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more significant arrhythmic delta activity particularly in the left posterior quadrant.  A high amplitude epileptiform discharge, high amplitude spike and slow wave complex is noted.  This demonstrates variable maximum and includes T5, T3, P3 __________.  Some waveforms differ substantially than others in their distribution.  At some point, using an average reference, the reference appears to be the most active focus.  The left posterior temporal or parietal region is the most active area of epileptiform activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation:  Did appear to accentuate the epileptiform activity. Heart rate 72 bpm. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Very prominent epileptiform discharge in the left posterior quadrant. Focal slowing with arrhythmic delta activity throughout the left hemisphere, most prominent in the left posterior temporal region. Marked __________ and slowing on the right. Questionable activation of the epileptiform activity on the left with photic stimulation. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic focus in the left hemisphere.  The previous craniotomy may accentuate the amplitude of the activity described above.  For this individual, with complex epileptiform activity, today, the activity is on the left rather than bilateral.\""

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. During the record, including on the 26th, the Phenobarbital was turned off. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial data on the 24th there are intermittent seizures occurring in the contexts of burst suppression. There are prolonged periods of suppression with brief seizures. However, by 16:28 the EEG is completely suppressed. This section of the record was previously dictated. Additional recording after 16:37 for the following subsequent days includes the following: October 24 to October 25: A suppressed EEG. The patient can be visualized in the unit. Technologist and nurses work with her. The background EEG remains markedly suppressed. October 25 to October 26: Again no definite cerebral activity is observed. The overall activity is very low voltage. Electrode artifacts and other artifacts are observed. There is no variability in the record, although there is some EKG artifact. October 26 to October 27: Background EEG continues to demonstrate an essentially suppressed pattern. There is some artifact picked up in the background. With the use of alternative montages the overall activity appears to be essentially artifactual.

Study from 2253 on October 23, 2008 through October 24, 2008 at 1043. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Due to continuous right frontal sharp waves patient is put higher in a pentobarbital coma. There seems to be more bursts of right frontal sharp waves consistent with the status, but there are some seen as well on the left. Pentobarbital is started at 125. At that time an intermittent suppression pattern is seen. Periods of bursts will go from 30 seconds to 1 minute and 40 seconds. When there is a return of the burst the patient is seen to reenter a status pattern of right frontal greater than left sharp waves, which can last for 20 seconds before there is return of suppression. As the records continues you have longer periods of suppression, but as soon as the patient returns to a burst pattern, again you see the nonconvulsive status pattern of the right predominantly frontal discharges. On the right there is definitely extension of these discharges throughout the hemisphere. A heart rate 60 beats per minute.

EEG is to rule out electrographic status epilepticus. MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat and Depakote. INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG reveals a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There is some frontal central beta seen best over the right hemisphere, at times seen over the left.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Some normal sleep architecture is seen. Abnormal discharges: Focal slow waves seen continuously over P3 and at times T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz.  Amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  Focal sharp waves are seen at O1 independently occasionally. Seizures: The patient had during this recording 2 electrographic seizures.  The first one occurring at 7:18 p.m. until 7:28 p.m. lasting for 10 minutes.  It appears to originate at O1 with rhythmic sharp waves in the theta frequency, that increasing amplitude and frequency and appeared to spread slightly to O2 but remained mainly in the occipital region.  During the event the patient moves around but no other clear clinical features can be seen in the video.  At 12:30 a.m. the patient had another seizure lasting 5 minutes.  This time the patient again was in the bed and no clinical seizures were seen.  In the EEG there was again in O1 an electrographic seizure that began with a discharge of spikes in the alpha frequency that continued to evolve to the theta frequency and increasing amplitude and then suddenly stopped. This one was spread less through the occipital region and stayed mainly at O1.  During the rest of the night no more seizures were seen until and this EEG was reviewed until 8:00 in the morning. Heart rate.  72. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to 2 electrographic seizures arising from the left occipital region, in addition to focal slowing seen continuously over the left hemisphere maximal in the parietal and temporal region. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals or is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with 2 seizures arising from the left occipital region.  In addition, there is no evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere maximum in the parietal and temporal region which may be related to the known tumor resection.  These findings were communicated to the primary team as they occurred.'"

Diffuse slowing indicates diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically non-specific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  There is an epileptogenic focus over the left frontal region.  Breach artifact is secondary to a skull defect.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.'"

Summary of Findings: Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left central Seizure, occasional, bilateral occipital Interpretation: This is a very ABNORMAL ~13 hour continuous video EEG due to occasional very focal bioccipital seizures, focal left central moderate slowing and mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing. These findings indicate a structural occipital epileptogenic focus and a structural left central structural abnormality. Lastly there is mild-to-moderate  diffuse background slowing that is etiologically non-specific.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.'"

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 82-year-old gentleman with history of aggressive behavior, admitted to the hospital with change in mental status and acute delirium for 3 days.  Head CT was negative for acute changes.  There was a concern for seizures and postictal changes. MEDICATIONS:  Risperdal and Haldol. INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Vertical stimulation was performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage II sleep. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-10 Hertz in frequency, 30-50 microvolt in amplitude, seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is frontocentral low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background and absence of eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindle.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple fresh frequencies and result in no remarkable driving response.  There are frequent bursts of bitemporal slowing at F7/T3 and F8/T4 more prominent on the left side or independent left temporal slowing at F7/T3 in wakefulness and sleep consisting of 1.5-2 Hertz.  Delta frequency 50-60 microvolts in amplitude lasting 1-2 seconds.  Heart rate was 75-80 beats per minute regular. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to bitemporal slowing left more than right side same during wakefulness and sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above finding are suggestive of either bilateral structural abnormalities or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  Other causes include metabolic toxic or infectious encephalopathy.  No epileptiform abnormalities were seen in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures or a clinical concern, a repeat EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.'"

The patient is holding onto the push button and telling the nurse about difficulty moving her leg.  There is some background theta from the left temporal region, but no clear epileptiform change, and the overall description of the symptoms is not like her more severe or her more mild seizures. EVENT TIME 15:19:47: The patient has a seven second-burst of high amplitude spike and slow wave activity from the left hemisphere.  Four seconds later, bilateral alpha activity is seen.  During the event, she is somewhat motionless and pushes the button at 15:20:08.  By the time she pushes the button, she is able to speak.  Of note, she pushes the button for a discharge lasting 15 seconds in duration. EVENT TIME 16:21:05: The patient is in the room with a nurse.  The EEG demonstrates an awake pattern.  At 16:28, she pulls up some yarn.  By 16:28:53, there is some rhythmic theta developing out the left hemisphere. The nurses are talking and the patient continues to knit, but she is actually not able to talk.  She is fiddling with the yarn.  She pushes the button at 16:29:09.  Of note, she pushes the button but she canÕt speak to the nurses.  The EEG activity continues to build up at 16:29:16 with rhythmic theta out of this.  The patient is no longer using her hands, and the yarn is still in her lap.  Although there is an alpha rhythm, there is clear build up of rhythmic temporal activity.  The patient is sitting motionless and the nurse observes the patient in this motionless state.  The seizure appears to be ending at 16:29:45 and at 16:29:48 she lifts her head up and is interactive again. EVENT TIME 17:13:34:  No clear EEG change is seen. EVENT TIME 18:16:32: Complex partial seizure at 18:15.  The patient is awake with materials on her tray.  Initially, there is the subtle onset of theta from the left hemisphere, which is discernable by 18:16:24.  At that time, there may even be a small amount on the right.  There is clear localization to the left temporal region by 18:16:44 with rhythmic theta and delta.  This is sharply contoured. This activity is over by 18:17:24. EVENT TIME 19:21:09: Actual seizure onset is 19:19:50.  The patient is lying in bed and appears to be drifting off to sleep, although there is an alpha rhythm identified.  Repetitive sharply contoured delta is picked up from the left hemisphere maximum at T1 at 19:20.  This demonstrates frequency evolution over the next 20 seconds.  There is an increase in fast activity, but an ongoing underlying left temporal theta over the next 20 seconds.  The patientÕs mother is rubbing her back.  The mother doesnÕt appear to be aware of the seizure.  The patient pushes the button essentially after the event is over, and the event seems to be ending at 19:21:00. EVENT TIME 19:42:  There is a lot of muscle, but no clear EEG change. EVENT TIME 21:25:  The patient is awake and talking to her mother.  At 21:24, there is a small increase in theta on the left.  This is relatively subtle, and this brief burst lacks the characteristic paroxysmal nature of the patientÕs more typical seizures. EVENT TIME  - Difficult to determine: The patient is moving about and talking.  There is the appearance of theta picked up at 21:29:10, with a clear evolution of frequency at 21:29:40 with a mixture of theta and sharply contoured delta from the left temporal region.  The seizure appears to be over by 21:31. EVENT TIME 22:15: There is a subtle increase in theta from the left temporal region at 21:16:20.  This seizure lacks clear or strong EEG correlates. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: This section of the record demonstrates sleep, unlike the initial sections of the record.  In stage II sleep, there are spindles and POSTS.  There is some shifting asymmetries in sleep, but the overall background is relatively symmetric.  There is sustained stage II sleep in this record.  There are rare right temporal sharp waves.  In comparison to other portions of the record, there are also occasional left temporal sharp waves seen in sleep independently.  In comparison to the initial portions of the record, there is less in the way of the bursts of paroxysmal fast activity from the right temporal region. OVERALL IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring due to: 1. Multiple complex partial seizures identified maximum in the left temporal region. 2. More than one pattern for this patientÕs left temporal seizures, some of which have a more stronger EEG signature than others, but all with the same localization. 3. Independent, left greater than right temporal spike and slow wave activity. 4. Intermittent bursts of fast activity from the right temporal region. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term monitoring session is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for this patientÕs epilepsy.'"

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10.20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is extremely agitated and upset about the EEG which increases as the study continues. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly slow and disorganized pattern. The patient is moving about throughout. This is primarily a theta frequency pattern. There may be an underlying C4 sharp wave discernable in the record, but the artifact really prohibits clear definition of this. Briefly, she becomes calmer and as she starts to drifts off to sleep there is more hypersynchronous theta followed by vertex waves. HR: 100 bpm and irregular IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Generalized background slowing with theta. 2. Perhaps a suggestion of a right central sharp wave. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is similar to her many previous EEGs. The only EEG which ever demonstrate epileptiform activity is the EEG which recorded a seizure. Because of the patient's agitation, consideration for avoidance of additional EEGs may be appropriate. This is her eleventh EEG this year.\""
