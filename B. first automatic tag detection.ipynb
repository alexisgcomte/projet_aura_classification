Seizures characterized by generalized shaking lasting 20 seconds. MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Tegretol, Tranxene, and many others. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy or somnolent. Photic stimulation is performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and is primarily a mixture of rhythmic 3 Hz activity with smaller amounts of 2 Hz activity and some 4 to 5 Hz theta.  There are multifocal spike and slow wave complexes identified in the record including bifrontal, high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes with an approximately 2 Hz after going slow wave.  Focal epileptiform activity is also seen in the occipital regions, sometimes maximum at O2 and at other times with a poly spike wave component at O1-O2.  The epileptiform activity may be seen independently in the right or left hemisphere including T5, FP1, F7, and C3. The patient is noted to snore occasionally, but there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a significant difference in terms of awake or asleep pattern, although there may be more frontally predominant delta in drowsiness.  There are occasional high amplitude, bifrontal poly spike and slow wave complexes. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. There are some shifting asymmetries in terms of the amount of theta or delta seen in the background. HR:  78 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Generalized slowing. Slow spike and wave activity. Multifocal spikes. CLINICAL CORRELATION: For this individual who had a childhood history of infantile spasms, the pattern described is compatible with a Lennox-Gastaut-type syndrome and/or a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.'"

MEDICATIONS: Lacosamide, dilantin, Ativan, Klonopin INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. As this section of the records begins, the patient reports \"he is feeling great\" as if he is not having more seizures. Then subsequently he has 2 events that he describes as auras, which are seizures with impairment of awareness. He does have occasional myoclonic jerks. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the 24-hour period includes more of the rhythmic repetitive slowing than noted at other times. Isolated high amplitude right hemispheric spike and wave activity is observed. Push button times include 5:20 which includes actually a seizure. Although the patient describes this as an aura, it is really a focal motor seizure with loss of axial tone and stiffening of the right leg. The patient seems to know that it is coming at 10:20:40 before he pushes the button and he seems to be a little bit confused. Unfortunately, he is moving about and there is muscle and movement artifact until he has loss of axial tone and stiffening on the right at 10:20:56. Characteristic tonic clonic activity obscures the EEG and although he is most jerking on the right, it seems to obscure the entire EEG. By 10:23:00 it seems to be over. The patient is back in bed and responsive to the nurses, helping them with the blood pressure cuff by 10:24. Seizure time 13:30. The patient is sitting in a chair. He puts his left hand to his nose at 13:29, but does not seem to be uncomfortable. For this seizure, the dad seems to know what is going on and pushes the button at 13:30, even before there is much that seems to be going on with the patient. The patient seems to be fine at 13:30:05, moving about. Additional sharp waves are noted at 13:34. This EEG monitor ends at 15:35 and at that time there is prominent sharp waves and rhythmic slowing. IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring was remarkable for: 1. High amplitude sharp waves and spikes in the left hemisphere, particularly parietal occipital region. 2. Some things which the patient describes as \"auras\" which are in the borderline between simple and complex partial seizures, which are associated with more rhythmic mixed theta delta. 3. A third seizure type, which seemed to be a focal motor seizure. 4. That same rhythmic discharge which was not always associated with change in awareness. CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEG monitoring and support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.'"

      "text/plain": "\" CLINICAL HISTORY:  Rasmussen's encephalitis with breakthrough seizures. MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, IVIG, phenobarbital, Klonopin, others. INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit.  During a section of the record, the patient has approximately 40 simple partial seizures, all characterized by involuntary movements on the right.  Other seizures can occur out of sleep, but in this 24-hour section almost all the seizures seem to wake him up and are associated with right-sided shaking. The seizures have variable patterns, but all localize to the left hemisphere.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep, in wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity with a high amplitude left posterior temporal spike complex. Clinical seizures are noted reliably with the patient and nurse and there are more than 20 pushbutton events, approximately 23, all 30-60 seconds in duration.  They are characterized by focal motor activity on the right hemibody.  Electrocardiographically, there is a buzz of mixed 5 and 10 Hz activity in the left hemisphere including the central regions.   There are a handful of seizures that when seizures occur as pairs where there is a bit more of a rhythmic delta pattern that precedes it.  So, if there are 2 seizures together, the second is not as well defined as the first.  Many of the seizures occur in sleep.  Some seem to have a beta buzz early on in the seizure. Heart rate 80 BPM. IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour section of EEG monitoring was remarkable for a large number of seizures.  The most disturbing seem to be have been those that occurred in sleep, but in fact, they were also seen in the early evening hours as well.  There may have been other events that looked like seizures, but were not associated with a pushbutton event and those occurred with the patient off camera, so it is difficult to know if these were clinically significant or not.  Of note, there are other sections in the record where the patient seems to have had seizures while sleeping which did not seem to disrupt his sleep at all.'"

MEDICATIONS:  Decadron, phenobarbital, lacosamide, Zocor, others. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was not experiencing involuntary movements during the EEG.  So this is a technically satisfactory EEG with acceptable impedances, but the craniotomy defect was noted. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal and demonstrates an asymmetry.  The right hemisphere is moderately slow with primarily a theta frequency background noted in wakefulness.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more significant arrhythmic delta activity particularly in the left posterior quadrant.  A high amplitude epileptiform discharge, high amplitude spike and slow wave complex is noted.  This demonstrates variable maximum and includes T5, T3, P3 __________.  Some waveforms differ substantially than others in their distribution.  At some point, using an average reference, the reference appears to be the most active focus.  The left posterior temporal or parietal region is the most active area of epileptiform activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation:  Did appear to accentuate the epileptiform activity. Heart rate 72 bpm. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Very prominent epileptiform discharge in the left posterior quadrant. Focal slowing with arrhythmic delta activity throughout the left hemisphere, most prominent in the left posterior temporal region. Marked __________ and slowing on the right. Questionable activation of the epileptiform activity on the left with photic stimulation. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic focus in the left hemisphere.  The previous craniotomy may accentuate the amplitude of the activity described above.  For this individual, with complex epileptiform activity, today, the activity is on the left rather than bilateral.\""

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness there are periods of fragmented moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity with preserved anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The majority of the background, however, consists of low amplitude fast activity admixed with polymorphic frequently sharply contoured central theta and delta activity.  Additionally, up to 20 second runs of sharply contoured frontocentral theta activity without spatial or temporal evolution are captured.  These runs are not ictal in etiology.  Occasional moderate amplitude isolated diffuse frontally predominant sharply contoured slow waves without clear spike waves or sharp waves are captured.  A good example of such waveform occurs at 09:59:50 a.m.  On a single occasion at 10:01:20 a.m., such discharge is correlated with a brief generalized body jerk.  There is a continuous diffuse EKG artifact.  No hyperventilation or photic stimulation are captured.  There is no normal sleep architecture captured. FINDINGS: 1. Mild diffuse slowing. 2. Runs of non-evolving frontocentral theta activity. 3. Isolated diffuse frontally predominant slow waves that on a single occasion correlates with the generalized body jerks. IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, runs of sharply contoured bifrontocentral activity and occasional diffuse waveforms without clearly formed sharp waveforms that on a single occasion are associated with brief generalized body jerks.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric diffuse disturbance of cerebral dysfunction.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.'"

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact.

He arouses just at the start of the seizure and then he moves around afterward, but during the seizure he is sleeping, face down. This seizure was 1.5 minutes in duration.

Early in the seizure there is prominent involvement in the bilateral frontal region, but the phase reversal is T2, with T2 and T4 being nearly isoelectric.  There is clear frequency evolution and bilateral activity.  Afterward there seems to be some muscle artifact. Several minutes later, the nurse comes in and does testing for the patient.

He arouses just at the start of the seizure and then he moves around afterward, but during the seizure he is sleeping, face down. This seizure was 1.5 minutes in duration.  It began with rhythmic theta frequency activity, most prominent in the T1-T2 electrode.  Early in the seizure there is prominent involvement in the bilateral frontal region, but the phase reversal is T2, with T2 and T4 being nearly isoelectric.  There is clear frequency evolution and bilateral activity.  Afterward there seems to be some muscle artifact. Several minutes later, the nurse comes in and does testing for the patient. There are sections in the record where the patient is asleep and the background is relatively low-voltage and featureless. There are intermittent bursts of frontal delta noted in the background but without clear clinical correlate. There is a handful of sharp waves noted in the left anterior temporal region. Later sections of the record are remarkable for some electrode artifact. March 7 through March 8:  During this section of the record, the patient notes no clinical seizures.  In addition, he is placed on a 1-to-1 because of the intermittent confusion and the seizure while lying face down asleep.  No seizures are recognized by the clinical team. The awake record is somewhat on a low-voltage side with a fair amount of movement artifact.  There are occasional bursts of spikes and sharps which seem to begin out of the right frontal region and some of it starts in the right frontal region with a triplet and then frontal delta. Compared to the first 24 hours of EEG recording, the frontal delta is no longer present in wakefulness and is decreasing overall.  The overnight sleep recording continues to demonstrate the frontal delta, but unfortunately there is more EKG artifact in the background during sleep at times.  The patient is noted to be sleeping during the day.  The interictal EEG does demonstrate some awake sharp waves in the right temporal region, and the drowsy EEG is more of a pattern of right or left, but unfortunately some times the electrode integrity is lost. HR:    72 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This EEG monitoring was remarkable for: One clinical seizure which seems to come from the right temporal region. Interictal epileptiform activity; right. left temporal sharp waves seen in wakefulness or sleep, a bit more prominent in the first 24 hours of recording. Bursts of frontal delta.  On occasion, these bursts seem to be preceded by right anterior temporal sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are diagnostic of a focal mechanism for seizures.  The overall background was improving in the second 24 hours.'"

The patient was awake, but unresponsive and incontinent. MEDICATIONS:  Carbamazepine, Metoprolol. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow.  There is excess theta identified.  There is a glimpse of an alpha reaching from 7-10 Hz.  In relaxed wakefulness, there are rare, high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. After this, as the patient becomes drowsy there are subtle F7/T1 sharp waves noted. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  Following photic stimulation a single, well defined right frontal temporal spike and slow wave complex is also noted and then later more discreet discharges, more compatible with a normal variant. In the final seconds of the EEG, another medium amplitude left anterior temporal discharge is identified, which is a spike. By the end of the recording, the background disorganization is somewhat improved. HR:    84 bpm IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Left anterior temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes which are rare. Excess background theta. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is a single well defined sharp wave on the right which must be considered artifact, although may represent variable distribution of the left anterior temporal sharp wave.  The background slowing does improve a bit as the recording continuous, which may be part of a postictal phenomenon.  Correlation with imaging given the presence of focal sharp waves or spikes in an adult is suggested.'"

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Fentanyl, Ativan. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is comatose, unresponsive, with intermittent eye blinking. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes multiple electrographic seizures which are clinically associated with eye blink.  Much of the EEG is, in fact, ictal with seizures seeming to wax and wane.  It is difficult at this point to determine when seizures begin and end, but the very first seizure for this patient seems to begin with a burst of rhythmic higher amplitude sharply contoured activity on the left.  Many of the seizures are characterized by high amplitude rhythmic theta-delta or spike-and-wave activity which is essentially bilateral.  Some seizures end with T6 spiking.  Others end with rhythmic sharply contoured activity on the left.  As the recording continues, the seizures begin with faster frequency activity alpha and beta out of the frontal regions and then a paroxysmal evolution.  Some of the seizures do have a clearly defined ending with a slow background and then the T6 periodic sharp waves.  There are sections of the record where there is a T6 sharp wave and a T1 burst of sharply contoured delta. As the recording continues, more of the epileptiform activity is in the right hemisphere and may be posterotemporal or anterior temporal. By 12:34, the nurse is providing Ativan.  As the record ends at 12:40, epileptiform activity is noted and has not resolved. HR:    120 bpm IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to: Multiple electrographic seizures which seem to emanate from the frontal regions but at least in some locations either begin or end with epileptiform activity in the left frontal or even right posterotemporal region. Interictal epileptiform activity from multiple different localizations including T1, T3, T4, and T6. Background slowing.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital and Depakote. INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Early in the recording, the background consists of moderate-amplitude generalized spikes, after-going slow waves, and polyspikes that have frontal predominance and are high in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  These discharges are continuous, occurring at approximately 2 to 2.5 Hz.  Additionally, there are intermittent bursts of generalized, frontally predominant, left-greater-than-right fast activity.  These bursts last from approximately 0.3 seconds to 1 second. In the second half of the recording, there is gradual decrease in diffuse voltage, epileptiform discharges become less pronounced.  By the end of the recording, generalized low-amplitude sharp waves observed.  Additionally, by the end of the recording, the background consists of frequent periods of discontinuity mixed with nearly continuous ventilator artifact.  Until approximately 9:40 p.m., intermittent seizures are captured.  Seizure frequency is approximately 2-4 seizures per hour early in the recording.  This seizure frequency decreases as the recording progresses with electrographic seizure recorded at approximately 9:39 p.m.  Seizures started with generalized, frontally predominant, left-greater-than-right fast activity.  This fast activity rapidly increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency.  There is no clear clinical correlate during these seizures.  Seizures have an abrupt offset with diffuse postictal slowing and attenuation observed.  Seizures last approximately 20-30 seconds. FINDINGS: Intermittent generalized seizures without clear clinical correlate that occur approximately 2-4 times per hour until approximately 9:39 p.m.  Last seizure recorded at approximately 9:39 p.m. Gradual voltage attenuation and severe diffuse background slowing as the recording progresses. IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal continuous video 24-hour electroencephalogram due to intermittent seizures until approximately 9:40 p.m., gradual background slowing and attenuation as the recording progresses.

His wife noticed lip smacking and staring but never returned to baseline. MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, and Vimpat. INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with 1 anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at times reaches 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta seen better over the left central region, however, there is attenuation of faster frequencies over the left temporal region.  At times, even during wakefulness, there is excessive theta seen throughout.  The patient is only recorded during wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Movement artifact throughout the recording. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow waves seen continuously over C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times these are sharply contoured but are seen through a breach. Focal slow waves at C4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts. Excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts. SEIZURES:  None. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left central continuous focal slowing which are at times sharply contoured in addition to right central focal slowing and excessive theta in wakefulness. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left central region in addition to independent focal cerebral dysfunction over the right central region, which is consistent with the patient: with a known history of bilateral subdural hemorrhages.  In addition, the faster frequency over the left temporal region is consistent with a known subdural over that region.  There is also evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or definite epileptiform discharges were seen.'"

Patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software as well as patient notes and nurse's notes and patient alarms were used to review the EEG. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, the recording appears to be mainly in the delta frequencies with some intermittent faster frequencies showing up periodically.  There are some stage changes noted.  No activating procedures were performed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves seen continuously at T5/P3 with a periodicity that ranges from 0.5 Hz to 2 Hz, at times becoming slightly less organized.  These are consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV. SEIZURES:  Although there were about 2-3 rhythmic runs of the PLEDs, there were 2 electrographic seizures.  One occurred at 4:15 p.m. lasting for a minute and a half.  The 2nd one occurred at 9:43 p.m.  Both of them did not appear to have any clear clinical correlate.  They were comprised of rhythmic P3-4/T5 sharp waves, evolving in frequency and amplitude and then suddenly stopping. HEART RATE:  84. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterior temporal and parietal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) and electrographic seizures in addition to generalized slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals left posterior temporal and parietal seizures as well as a focus of irritability and cerebral dysfunction in that region.  This is likely related to the known lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral  dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.\""

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, famotidine, Lovenox, topiramate, Flagyl, Depakote, and Vimpat. INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software was used to review the events.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  Overall there are theta-delta mixed frequencies intermingled with multiple multifocal spikes, which I will describe in the abnormal discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Multifocal spikes seen at O1, O2, T6, FP1, FP2, T3, and T4.  However, the majority of the spikes are seen on O1, O2 and less so at FP1/FP2. Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording. SEIZURES:  Again during the recording there are multiple seizures, about 13 of them, some of them lasting up to 30 minutes where the EEG appears to seldom display a rhythmic sharply contoured theta intermixed at beta and at times maximally frontally and centrally with an overlying rhythmic occipital sharp focus.  It is unclear where the origin of the seizure is.  It is also atypical in that it does not clearly evolve, it just suddenly starts and appears to slowly stop.  The patient appears to move her head side to side and arms moving in a wild flinging fashion. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple seizures with unclear origin and multifocal spikes.

INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of diffuse rhythmic and semi-rhythmic high amplitude frontally predominant delta activity mixed with bursts of diffuse spindle-like wave forms.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  At least 3 electrographic seizures are noted. These seizures start with approximately a 10-12 second run of fast activity most pronounced over the right occipital lead.  This activity eventually spread to the right anterior region. During this spread, rhythmic more frequency theta and delta activity are captured over the right anterior leads with some reflection over the left hemisphere.  Seizure offset is gradual.  Total seizure duration is approximately one minute.  Increase in heart rate up to 150 to 180 beats a minutes is noted during seizure.  During one of the seizures, the patient bites on the ET tube. A single EKG lead demonstrates continued tachycardia with heart rate on average of approximately 120 beats a minute. FINDINGS: At least 3 electrographic seizures with right occipital onset lasting approximately 1 minute. Runs of bilateral posterior fast activity. Moderate to severe diffuse slowing. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to moderate diffuse slowing, intermittent high frequency activity observed posteriorly, as well as 3 focal right hemisphere electrographic seizures with onset of right occipital leads.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction, that in this case could partially be related to medications.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old man with a history of epilepsy since he was 5 years old, who presents noncompliant with medications and with recurrent refractory seizures.  EEG to quantify and differentiate seizures. MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Depakote, as well as Keppra. INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  No activation procedures were performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  At about 11 p.m., the patient started becoming agitated and moving and disconnected multiple of his leads and by 1 in the morning, unfortunately the majority of his leads were lost and the recording could not be continued.  This is only a 17-hour recording. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at best 6-7 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The patient does appear to go into sleep, but the sleep architecture is not typical.  No activating procedures were performed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: There are rare bifrontal sharp waves seen in sleep, which appear to be maximal at possibly F4 with a prefrontal field. Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording. SEIZURES:  Three seizures were recorded during this long-term monitoring.  The first one occurred at 10:15 in the morning.  Clinically, the patient is laying in bed and appears to grunt and suddenly jerks.  It lasts for what appears to be 20 seconds.  Electrographically at the beginning of the seizure, there is predominantly frontal beta discharge with associated attenuation that appears in both frontal regions and appears to continue as it is obscured by muscle artifact.  Afterwards, there appears to be some slowing in the frontal region.  Although the slowing is difficult to distinguish from its usual background.  The second seizure occurred at 2:41 p.m., lasting for 30 seconds.  This one occurs from sleep.  The patient suddenly moves his right arm and the right hand clearly becomes dystonic suddenly, the right arm then becomes forcefully extended, he grunts, and suddenly the seizure stops.  The nurse came into the room, but did not test him until the seizure had clinically and electrographically stopped.  Electrographically at onset there appears to be again a frontal predominant beta discharge and diffuse attenuation, which continues to evolve and then gets obscured by muscle artifact.  After the event, there appears to be some more prominent diffuse slowing.  Seizure number 3 occurs at 8:51 p.m., about 40 seconds after waking up.  The patient suddenly grunts and his right arm moves underneath the covers and cannot be seen.  This lasts about 30 seconds and then suddenly stops.  Electrographically again there is a frontal beta discharge, which is associated with diffuse attenuation and appears to continue to evolve and then no longer seen due to muscle artifact.  After the seizure appears to clinically end, there seems to be some diffuse slowing. Heart rate is 86. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to 3 seizures likely arising from either frontal lobe in addition to diffuse slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with 3 seizures likely arising from the frontal region with unclear lateralization.  The right arm dystonic posture in one of them suggests a possible left frontal onset, although this cannot be certain.  These seizures were communicated to the team as the EEG was performed.  Lastly, there is evidence of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.'"

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The waking background is somewhat disorganized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with prominent, sharply contoured frontal theta as the patient drifts off to sleep, there are bursts of frontal slowing and vertex waves but underneath this there seems to be a shifting right or left frontocentral sharp wave. The patient is noted to be very sleepy and requires stimulation to stay away through hyperventilation but near the beginning of hyperventilation, occasional right frontocentral sharp waves are observed. At this time, again, this asymmetric frontal mixed theta delta is noted again more prominent on the right. Photic stimulation is remarkable for an individual who is drifting into deeper stages of sleep and there is no definitive driving response. HR: 78bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Background stowing and disorganization. 2. Excess theta. 3. Bursts of frontally predominant slowing with mixed rhythmic theta and delta which are a bit more prominent from the right. 4. Sharp waves in the right frontocentral region. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. The epileptiform activity and the focal slowing, however, seem to be more prominent from the right.'"

CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single lead EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude diffuse theta admixed with occasional delta.  During sleep, the degree of delta increases.  Brief bifrontal fast activity is captured.  A single electrographic seizure is captured.  Clinically, it occurs out of sleep when the technologist wakes up the patient for hyperventilation.  During the seizure, the patient does not respond and appears to have possible right hand systemic posturing.  Electrographically, there is rapid diffuse voltage attenuation and appearance of diffuse fast activity that is most pronounced bifrontally.  The seizure lasts approximately 35-40 seconds.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and does not result in significant change in the background.  Photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities. FINDINGS: Mild to moderate diffuse slowing. Occasional bifrontal brief fast activity. A single clinical and electrographic seizure out of wakefulness of unclear lateralization, possibly bifrontal in onset. IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 25-minute awake and asleep EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing, bifrontal fast activity that is likely to be epileptiform in nature, and a single approximately 40 second seizure out of sleep of unclear lateralization, possibly frontal in onset.  Diffuse slowing indicates nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.   Epileptiform discharges and seizure indicate near cortical origin of the patient's epilepsy.

Patient had multiple seizures over the last 48-hour long-term EEG monitoring.  Due to the frequency of the non-convulsive epilepsy, the patient was transported to the ICU today and continues on long-term monitoring. MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Phenobarbital.   INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the Long-Term EEG Monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.  DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, disorganized with excessive slow theta and delta activity.  There is a nearly continuous left frontocentral and temporal arrhythmic and polymorphic delta activity.  At times the sharp activity is also seen in this area.  The digital camera did not record any physical seizures, however, several non-convulsive electrographic epileptic discharges were identified.   EVENTS: The patient had several episodes of electrographic seizures without convulsions including at 07:36, 08:00, 12:04, 12:06, 12:43, 13:24, 13:46, 14:12, and 15:37.  Electrographically, sharply contoured activity initially emanates from the left central area and then generalized to involve the entire cortex diffusely.  At that time, a 4 to 5 Hz, spike and slow wave activity with diffuse muscle activity is seen, lasting for about three minutes before subsiding. Continuous sharply contoured activity and some sharp and spike waves with slow wave complexes are still seen in the left frontocentral area.  Clinically and on the video camera, the patient gradually turns his head to the right with occasional flexion of both arms, but most often with the right arm.  When the epileptiform discharges stop, both arms return to their normal position.  In some episodes, the patient can even answer questions from his family, the nurse, or doctor.

MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, and many others. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient receives ____________ [to be filled in] during this recording.  He is mostly lethargic. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Complex partial seizures are identified.  The first identified is at 17:53 with the appearance of rhythmic theta frequency activity from the left frontocentral region.  Precise seizure onset is somewhat challenging.  The activity clearly shows frequency evolution with the appearance of bilateral, frontocentral rhythmic theta frequency and sharp and slow wave activity as well as faster frequency activity.  The activity gradually wanes and by 17:55:41 the seizure is more clearly over and the EEG has returned to its baseline, which includes generalized background slowing with focal slowing and breach rhythm and sharp activity in the left frontal region. SEIZURE, TIME 21:32 to 21:35: This seizure begins with high alpha frequency activity, maximum in the left frontocentral region.  Despite some artifacts in the background, there is clear frequency evolution of this activity as well as a spread to a bilateral pattern.  The patient is lethargic, there are no clinical signs seen during this seizure, and despite what seems to be muscle, there is no apparent movement of the patient. Long-Term Monitoring, 1/31/04 to 2/01/04 SEIZURE, TIME 16:57:34: The patient is in a darkened room.  The family is at the bedside.  The family notes that within 14 seconds of the seizure onset, the patient is poorly responsive and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t follow commands.  This seizure has a somewhat different pattern than his usual seizures, with initially a brief burst of rhythmic, frontally predominant theta activity and then some faster frequency activity and then more prolonged arrhythmic delta from the left frontocentral regions. Long-Term Monitoring, 2/01/04 to 2/02/04 No seizures were noted in this portion of the record. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness through stage II sleep, there is ongoing focal slowing from the left frontocentral region, with a focal breach rhythm in the left frontocentral region.  In sleep, there seems to be focal fast activity, which is not necessarily spindle-like and is in the frontal region, but does not evolve.  Elements of stage I sleep include vertex waves. IMPRESSION: Abnormal long-term video EEG monitoring due to: Multiple complex partial seizures recorded with various different patterns, but all of which are localized to the left frontocentral region. Focal slowing. Sharp waves maximum at F3, occasional C3 and F7. CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the last 24 hours of this record, no additional seizures were recorded. This EEG is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for epilepsy.'"

He had a recent seizure on March 25, 2013.  Current seizure frequency is approximately once every few months. TIME OF START:  1:51 p.m. TIME OF RECORDING END:  2:15 p.m. MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens there is a clear hemispheric asymmetry with the appearance of a 7-8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm seen in the right occipital leads and a fragmentary or nonexistent posterior dominant rhythm of the left occipital region.  There is obvious focal slowing noted in the theta and delta range over the entire left hemisphere, maximal in the frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.  This includes frequencies in the delta 2-3 Hz range and theta 5-6 Hz frequency range.  The focal slowing is nearly continuous throughout the duration of the recording and there are very few normal rhythms seen over the left hemisphere.  Stage 1 sleep is seen and is characterized by attenuation of the existing posterior dominant rhythm over the right.  Stage 2 sleep is briefly seen and heralded by vertex waves and asymmetric sleep spindles of higher amplitude over the right. Hyperventilation was not performed on this patient.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not induce a significant photic driving response. There were no spikes identified, however, there were intermittent sharp waves identified maximal at F7 or F3 over the left frontal region several times during the recording.  These seemed most prominent during periods of drowsiness.  There were, however, no electrographic seizures identified during the recording. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep due to the presence of continuous focal slowing over the left hemisphere and the appearance of infrequent frontal sharp waves in the left frontal region maximal at F7 and F3.  Clinical correlation in the presence of focal slowing is suggestive of a structural brain lesion in this region such as a stroke, which is part of this patient's history.  The presence of focal sharp waves in the left frontal region suggest an epileptogenic focus in this region.\""

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Spike detector and seizure detector software were activated.  Nursing staff and medical staff notes were reviewed.  The recording was reviewed intermittently throughout the recording epoch. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During maximal wakefulness the background consisted of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is captured, however, periods of quiescence characterized by diffuse spindle-like wave forms and intermittent periods of brief background discontinuity are captured.   Electrographic seizures occur on the average of approximately 1 per hour.  The last electrographic seizure occurs at approximately 8:30 p.m.  Seizure duration on the average is approximately 1 minute.  Electrographically seizure starts with rhythmic alpha frequency range activity observed over the left frontal region.  This activity rapidly spreads throughout the left parasagittal region and over the left anterior temple region.  A seizure evolves, rhythmic theta increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency with some reflection over the right hemisphere.  There is a gradual decrease in the wave form frequency until seizure gradually stops.  No official neurological testing is performed during any of these events.  Beta review does not demonstrate clear associated clinical correlation.  The last seizure captured was at approximately 8:30 p.m.  This corresponds to IV loading the patient with Dilantin shortly prior to the last seizure. FINDINGS: Moderate diffuse slowing. Frequent brief periods of discontinuity, especially during sleep.

MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include:  Keppra, Zonisamide, Ativan as needed. CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was performed continuously.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Medical staff notes and nursing notes were reviewed.  Spike detector and seizure detector software was activated.  The study was reviewed on several occasions throughout the recording epoch by an attending neurologist. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Early in the recording the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  As the recording progresses the degree of delta increases and the degree of background discontinuity increases as well.  During sleep diffuse spindle-like complexes are observed.  There are intermittent seizures throughout the recording.  In the beginning of the recording seizures occur several times per hour.  An additional dose of Keppra and Ativan were administered at approximately 3:15 p.m.  After this seizure frequency decreases to an average of approximately 1 seizure per hour.  However, several seizures are captured between 9:27 p.m. and 9:50 p.m.  The seizures last on an average of approximately 60 to 80 seconds up to approximately 130 seconds.  Throughout  the majority of the recording the seizures appeared to be left occipital in onset.  However, several seizures are left frontocentral in onset and by the end of the recording the seizures appeared to be left frontal in onset.  All of the seizures evolve electrographically in a similar pattern.  The seizures start with rhythmic alpha activity that evolves in amplitude and frequency, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency, and spreading throughout the left hemisphere.  As the seizure evolves the frequency of rhythmic activity decreases and gradually stops.  No clinical testing is performed during these seizures. FINDINGS: Moderate diffuse slowing that increases in severity as the recording progresses. Focal left  hemispheric slowing. Intermittent focal seizures, left hemispheric in onset, primarily left occipital in onset or left frontocentral in onset.  Seizure frequency is from approximately 1 per hour up to several per hour (focal status epilepticus).  Seizure duration is approximately 1 to 2 minutes. IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 18 hour continuous video EEG monitoring due to moderate diffuse slowing that increases in severity as the recording progresses, focal left hemispheric slowing, and intermittent left occipital/frontocentral focal onset seizures that intermittently increase in frequency into frank focal status epilepticus.  Diffuse focal slowing indicates etiologically specific diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is likely partially medication related.  Focal left hemispheric slowing and focal onset seizures indicate focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and this is consistent with the patient's history of a left middle cerebral artery territory stroke.  Seizure frequency decreases several hours into the recording and is related to demonstration of additional antiepileptic medications.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology Team.\""

MEDICATIONS:  Narcotics, zonisamide, primidone, benzodiazepines.  Will add the rest later. INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background is of low amplitude consistent with delta slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of less than 20 microvolts seen continuously. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves seen frequently at C44/F4 seen almost continuously throughout the recording. Focal slow waves seen continuously at C44/F4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts with additional asymmetric increased amplitude and faster frequencies consistent with a breach. SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording, there were about 6 seizures which appeared to have an electrographic onset, sometimes at O2 and at times at C4 beginning with high-frequency beta discharge that could again start on the occipital region or the central region and increase in frequency and then in amplitude, later to slow down in frequency but increase in amplitude and would spread either from the occipital region towards the central region at C4 or from the central region to the occipital region and continue to evolve.  They would last for about 1 minute to 2 minutes.  Clinically, the patient appears to open his eyes and roll his eyes towards the right and may have some twitching of his arm and mouth movements.  The tech did question him once and he remained unresponsive. HEART RATE:  120s between seizures and 134 while having a seizure. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to recurrent seizures as well as right central focal slowing and sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising either from the right occipital or central region.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegia, ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, seizure disorder, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, hydrocephalus, and a history of encephalitis, now with recurrent seizures, rule out status. MEDICATIONS:  Narcotics, zonisamide, primidone, benzodiazepines.  Will add the rest later. INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background is of low amplitude consistent with delta slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of less than 20 microvolts seen continuously. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves seen frequently at C44/F4 seen almost continuously throughout the recording. Focal slow waves seen continuously at C44/F4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts with additional asymmetric increased amplitude and faster frequencies consistent with a breach. SEIZURES:  Throughout the recording, there were about 6 seizures which appeared to have an electrographic onset, sometimes at O2 and at times at C4 beginning with high-frequency beta discharge that could again start on the occipital region or the central region and increase in frequency and then in amplitude, later to slow down in frequency but increase in amplitude and would spread either from the occipital region towards the central region at C4 or from the central region to the occipital region and continue to evolve.  They would last for about 1 minute to 2 minutes.  Clinically, the patient appears to open his eyes and roll his eyes towards the right and may have some twitching of his arm and mouth movements.  The tech did question him once and he remained unresponsive. HEART RATE:  120s between seizures and 134 while having a seizure. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to recurrent seizures as well as right central focal slowing and sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising either from the right occipital or central region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral, structural cerebral dysfunction and irritability over the right central and frontal region.  These findings were discussed with the primary team as soon as the EEG was read.  Long-term EEG will be performed.'"

The patient is awake. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG Is markedly abnormal with primarily a theta frequency background. There are bursts of generalized spike and wave and slow spike and wave activity. 'The bursts are typically 3 to 5 seconds in duration. There is also some more restricted frontally predominant spike and wave activity, a little more at the midline. Focal epileptiform activity is also observed including CZ, C3, and left anterior temporal. What appears to be generalized paroxysmal fast activity of approximately alpha frequency is noted. The patient drifts off to sleep with vertex waves and in sleep there seems to be ongoing slow spike and wave activity. In the transition to sleep, felt parietal sharp waves are noted. Photic stimulation does no activate the record. HR: 60 to 70 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1, Abnormal background. 2, Slow spike and wave activity with variable maximum, sometimes a bit more prominent in the left parietal region. 3. Focal epileptiform activity. 4. Background slowing and disorganization. CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are relatively characteristic in individuals with a Lennox-Gastaut type syndrome in terms of epilepsy. They are associated with cognitive impairment and typically more refractory epilepsy with multiple seizure types. These findings observed today were not associated with clinical changes but if there are additional questions, additional EEG recording may be obtained. Correlation with the patient's imaging and anti epileptic drug levels is suggested.\""

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.  This was a technically challenging EEG in an uncooperative patient . In addition, T1-T2 impedances were challenging. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the recording begins, the patient is awake.  There is significant muscle artifact noted in the background.  Underneath the muscle artifact, there appeared to be frontal spike and slow wave complexes, maximum at the midline with variable spread to the right or left.  These bursts occur in wakefulness lasting 1 to 3 seconds.  There are irregular, but clearly present underneath the muscle and movement artifact.  In addition, there is also frontal eye movement artifact.  A 9Hz alpha rhythm is noted in wakefulness As the patient becomes drowsy, high amplitude irregular, 2.5 Hz spike and wave activity and polyspike and wave complexes are identified.  Some of these are frontally predominant and a little bit more maximum on the left.  As the patient becomes drowsy, additional frontally predominant spike wave bursts reaching 4.5 Hz are noted.  Some of these are a bit more maximal on the right and others a bit more at PZ.  Other features of relaxed wakefulness include intermittent attenuations of the background.  Rare, frontal polyspike activity was also noted. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was becoming drowsy.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response with an increase in faster frequency activity, but it may also accentuate the spike and wave activity. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Marked background slowing and disorganization. 2. Frontally predominant spike and wave activity and polyspike and wave activity. 3. Variability in terms of epileptiform activity which may be more maximum in the left hemisphere or on the right. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to the previous EEG 3 years ago, this EEG demonstrates more slow spike and wave activity and less in the way of focal epileptiform features.  Both EEGs are supportive of a secondary generalized mechanism for epilepsy. __________________________'"

The patient reports feeling anxious at the start of the study. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the background EEG opens, the patient has generous background beta. There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with rhythmic activity in the right temporal region. For some reason, there is a pause in the EEG at the beginning of the record. The patient is staring forward. When the EEG resumes at 1:27:01, there is artifact, but the minute that the artifact stops, the EEG demonstrates a clear, high amplitude, right anterior temporal seizure with 4 to 5 Hz activity in the right temporal region with an admix spike. The activity is extremely high amplitude with a phase reversal at F8 and T2. The activity ends abruptly at 1:38:56. The overall duration of the seizure appears to be approximately 3 minutes but the seizure onset is unclear. By the end of the seizure, the activity is involving the right frontal region and also the midline and to a lesser extent the left frontal region. Immediately afterward, the patient is able to answer questions but is amnestic for the event. Following the seizure, occasional arrhythmic delta activity is seen in the right temporal region with a complex. The patient drifts into stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts. The patient is in stage II sleep during photic stimulation. HR: 72 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1.

MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Dilantin, Depakote. INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software as well as nurses' notes were all used in addition to reviewing the EEG to make this report. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record begins with a background that is slightly slow, particularly the posterior dominant rhythm appears to be mainly in the theta frequency, about 7 Hz, and it is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There is some frontal beta that starts to be seen some hours into the recording which continues to improve as well as the background increases in frequency.  Some sleep architecture is seen, and state changes are noted.  No activating procedures were performed. Abnormal discharges: 1. Focal slow waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximal at F3/C3 as well as T5/P3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  This slowing is seen continuously throughout the recording. 2. Generalized slowing at 5 to 7 Hz, seen at early onset of the recording.  It appears to improve slowly throughout the lasts hours of the recording. Seizures:  At 10:09 p.m., there appears to be an occipital seizure commencing at O1 with intermittent theta frequency sharp waves that continue to increase in frequency and amplitude but remain over the left occipital hemisphere and continue to discharge for about 20 minutes.  During this time there appears to be no clinical correlate to the patient seen in the video. Heart rate 90. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a single left occipital electrographic seizure, in addition to continuous left hemispheric slowing and mild generalized slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with a single electrographic seizure arising from the left occipital region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximal in the central frontal region, which is consistent with the known tumor resection.  Lastly, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  These findings were reported continuously to the primary team.\""

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tylenol, Lovenox, Dilantin, Depakote and phenobarbital. INTRODUCTION: A long term EEG was performed using a standard 10/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures were not performed. Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software, as well as nurse's notes and patient's events were used to review the EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record overall has a right posterior dominant rhythm that can be seen over the right hemisphere that reaches 8.5 Hz, but not over the left hemisphere. There is normal beta over the right hemisphere only. Patient appears to go into different stages of sleep, but no normal sleep architecture is clearly observed. No activating procedures were performed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow waves are seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximal at T3. These can become very monomorphic and rhythmic with at times an overlying frontal theta that is very sharply contoured and appearing in bursts of one second, occurring intermittently. Overall, this pattern seems to improve by the later hours of the recording and it appears to be less monomorphic and none of that frontal theta is seen. There is some intermittent faster frequency seen at the end of the recording. SEIZURES: The patient had three seizures during the recording. The first occurred at 8:44 p.m., the second one occurred at 10:30 p.m., and the last one occurred at 1:13 in the morning. Although the video was not clear on all of them, the patient first appears to turn his head to the right, with his eyes twitching in a nystagmoid fashion with a faster component towards the right, and this movement of the head is clearly versive. This is followed by right arm extension and left arm flexion and the sign of four, while afterwards generalizing and having clonic movements. The seizures usually last a minute and 40 seconds to two minutes. During all three seizures, the onset of the seizure in the EEG is not clear, as it rapidly obscured by muscle artifact, but during the seizure there appears to be some left prefrontal sharp waves seen. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to three secondary generalized seizures, likely arising from the left frontal region based on semiology, in addition to left hemispheric continuous focal slowing CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy, now with status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising from the left hemisphere, likely frontal region, based on semiology. In addition to revealing evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximal in the temporal region which is consistent with a known injury.

This is an awake and drowsy record in a cooperative patient. MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Vimpat. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The right hemisphere includes an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  The left hemisphere demonstrates some underlying focal slowing in the left posterior temporal region with a breach rhythm, accentuation of amplitude in that region, some underlying delta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. In the context of a breach rhythm, there is an underlying, P3/T5 sharp waves, primarily noted at P3. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  Hyperventilation produces some bilateral slowing.  Frontally predominant rhythmic theta was noted in hyperventilation. Heart rate 78 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to: Background slowing noted from both hemispheres, the left more so than the right. Subtle underlying delta noted in the left hemisphere, particularly in the posterior quadrant. Breach rhythm. Subtle underlying left parietal sharp waves in the context of a breech rhythm. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual with a structural lesion and previous status epilepticus, this EEG is improved compared to other studies.  The patient is clearly awake with a well-formed alpha rhythm on the right, although it is a bit slow.  The focal features described above are compatible with the patient's known structural abnormality.  No seizures were recorded.\""

This burst suppression pattern continues to be seen throughout the recording with bursts  sometimes being slightly longer and the interburst interval being shorter, but around 4 p.m., the propofol started being titrated down, tapered off slowly.  About 9:30 p.m. there appears to be a more continuous EEG pattern seen again which consists of diffuse delta slowing with some frontal theta bursts seen intermittently.

MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Dilantin, Depakote. INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software as well as nurses' notes were all used in addition to reviewing the EEG to make this report. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record begins with a background that is slightly slow, particularly the posterior dominant rhythm appears to be mainly in the theta frequency, about 7 Hz, and it is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There is some frontal beta that starts to be seen some hours into the recording which continues to improve as well as the background increases in frequency.  Some sleep architecture is seen, and state changes are noted.  No activating procedures were performed. Abnormal discharges: 1. Focal slow waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximal at F3/C3 as well as T5/P3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  This slowing is seen continuously throughout the recording. 2. Generalized slowing at 5 to 7 Hz, seen at early onset of the recording.  It appears to improve slowly throughout the lasts hours of the recording. Seizures:  At 10:09 p.m., there appears to be an occipital seizure commencing at O1 with intermittent theta frequency sharp waves that continue to increase in frequency and amplitude but remain over the left occipital hemisphere and continue to discharge for about 20 minutes.  During this time there appears to be no clinical correlate to the patient seen in the video. Heart rate 90. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a single left occipital electrographic seizure, in addition to continuous left hemispheric slowing and mild generalized slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with a single electrographic seizure arising from the left occipital region.

INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG reveals a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is best seen over the right hemisphere.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tylenol, Lovenox, Dilantin, Depakote and phenobarbital. INTRODUCTION: A long term EEG was performed using a standard 10/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures were not performed. Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software, as well as nurse's notes and patient's events were used to review the EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record overall has a right posterior dominant rhythm that can be seen over the right hemisphere that reaches 8.5 Hz, but not over the left hemisphere. There is normal beta over the right hemisphere only. Patient appears to go into different stages of sleep, but no normal sleep architecture is clearly observed. No activating procedures were performed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow waves are seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximal at T3. These can become very monomorphic and rhythmic with at times an overlying frontal theta that is very sharply contoured and appearing in bursts of one second, occurring intermittently. Overall, this pattern seems to improve by the later hours of the recording and it appears to be less monomorphic and none of that frontal theta is seen. There is some intermittent faster frequency seen at the end of the recording. SEIZURES: The patient had three seizures during the recording. The first occurred at 8:44 p.m., the second one occurred at 10:30 p.m., and the last one occurred at 1:13 in the morning. Although the video was not clear on all of them, the patient first appears to turn his head to the right, with his eyes twitching in a nystagmoid fashion with a faster component towards the right, and this movement of the head is clearly versive. This is followed by right arm extension and left arm flexion and the sign of four, while afterwards generalizing and having clonic movements. The seizures usually last a minute and 40 seconds to two minutes. During all three seizures, the onset of the seizure in the EEG is not clear, as it rapidly obscured by muscle artifact, but during the seizure there appears to be some left prefrontal sharp waves seen. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to three secondary generalized seizures, likely arising from the left frontal region based on semiology, in addition to left hemispheric continuous focal slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy, now with status epilepticus with multiple seizures arising from the left hemisphere, likely frontal region, based on semiology. In addition to revealing evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximal in the temporal region which is consistent with a known injury.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a prolonged study for a patient who appeared to have had a subclinical seizure. She was confused during the EEG and somewhat lethargic. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The background from the right hemisphere is slow and disorganized. The left hemisphere includes a high amplitude breech rhythm with a left frontal sharp and slow complex with arrhythmic delta activity. At 9:15 the patient is relatively inattentive and the technologist wraps the head. At some point essentially continuous spiking is noted in the left frontal region. A seizure is identified at 9:19 characterized by evolution of epileptiform activity in the left frontal region, which is high amplitude with a generous field of spread. The seizure duration is from 19:13:30 to 19:19:59 suggesting that this is a relatively brief seizure. The technologist transitions from this to additional recording at 09:21. After the first event with impaired responsiveness, high amplitude left frontal spiking is noted with a breech rhythm in the abnormal background. The patient's mental status actually improves somewhat. She moves about, although she is confused. The activity remains quite slow in both hemispheres. There was another brief build up again at 9:40. Artifacts are picked up at 9:35, but again there is prominent spiking in the background with very prominent epileptiform activity. A third electrographic seizure occurs at 9:58:57. The patient is relatively somnolent. Stimulation of the patient does not occur during this testing, but the seizure stops by itself and as it does the patient moves about. By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow. Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate. Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor. Her head is off the monitor. She appears to be sleepy. At  13:35 she was awake and the seizure is 12 minutes later. At 13:44 with the patient with someone at the bedside, in fact a physician examining her, the left frontal delta is prominent as are some sharp waves but she is interactive somewhat with the individual examining her. As the student leaves, the patient drifts over to the right. The electrographic seizure is at 13:47:13 and the patient is not really moving during the event but starts to reposition afterwards. This event is characterized by rhythmic, faster frequency activity in the left frontal and temporal region with also a beta accentuation. After the seizure was over, the patient looks about. HR: 78 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to: 1. Well-defined electrographic seizures noted but with only one seizure In the last 24 hours of recording. 2. Left frontotemporal focus. 3. Focal slowing from the left. 4. Generalized background slowing quite marked in the beginning of the record but better at the close of the record. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. Additional recording may be appropriate if this patient's mental status does not improve. HR: 78 bpm IMPRESSION: This section of EEG, which includes a routine 20 minute EEG, followed by 50 minutes of recording, includes multiple, brief complex partial seizures. Although the patient's mental status is abnormal, the clinical correlate for this patient's seizures includes impaired responsiveness. INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the LTM unit using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. The patient has a pattern of improving mental status over the course of the day. She, unfortunately, eliminated her EEG electrodes during the overnight recording. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the improved clinical appearance of the patient, there are electrographic seizures identified. These occur when the patient is in bed sleeping, without clinical correlate. They are associated with runs and bursts of activity. Time: 19:0838 - Approximately 1 minute in duration. Time: 19:5442 - Another seizure, maximum, in the left frontal and temporal region with a generous field of spread. Of note, the majority of the electrographic seizures are at approximately 8 p.m. and shortly thereafter the patient starts to remove the EEG electrodes. Of note, however, the patient did receive Versed in the morning and although there were frequent high amplitude left frontocentral sharp waves, the recurrence of seizures was primarily many hours afterwards. INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Electrographic seizures for this individual were well-defined with characteristic frequency evolution despite the prominent interictal sharp waves from the left frontocentral region and frontotemporal region. INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. At least one electrographic seizure is noted but no clinical seizures are observed. The patient's mental status gradually improves over the course of the record with the patient able to eat and get out of bed as well as participate in care. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections in this epoch include a markedly slow pattern with slower delta and rhythmic theta frequency from both hemispheres and high amplitude sharp and slow or spike and slow wave complexes, many of which are frontotemporal but some of which are T1. The patient is certainly much sleepier on the 6th compared to the 7th. By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow. Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate. Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  The patient is poorly responsive and has a tracheostomy. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  Multiple electrographic seizures are noted with high amplitude epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere, typically maximum in the left frontal central region, but with a generous field of spread.

Despite the marked background slowing, the patient seems to be somewhat responsive.  During the seizures, he has head turning to the right, but not really a forced deviation, more of a more gentle head turning.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous  video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This overnight EEG was recorded in several pieces. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The first section opens on the 5th at 9:32 a.m.  The patient is having left frontal focal seizures.  He stares off into space. He looks to the right.  A person comes in and it is not clear that he is particularly interactive during the seizure.  His mouth is open.  The nurses work with the patient as the seizure stops and he looks about afterwards.  The first piece of long term video EEG monitoring data primarily shows seizures in the early part of the morning.  By 1:07, the patient seems to have received medications.  Seizures again occur and are picked up by the seizure and spike detector and can be seen at 1:52.  There is a montage change to focus on the left frontal region.  Although the patient is no longer seizing in the form of a continuous seizure, there are multiple seizures per hour. This piece of EEG data concludes at 15:09 p.m. The second piece of EEG data which begins at 13:27 is not available for review.  The next available data is at midnight on the night of the 5th.  The EEG continues to demonstrate seizures from the left frontal region.  As was the case in the previous night, seizures are quite common at 1 a.m. for this individual and there is once again a pattern of almost continuous ictal activity.  This is again noted at 3 a.m.  It appears to be slowing at 6:21 a.m., but seizures recur at 6:28 and 6:37. Intermittent seizures or left frontal plebs are noted throughout the remainder of the record.  The EEG on the morning of the 6th continues to demonstrate intermittent seizures and plebs.  The patient is, however, sometimes responsive particularly when the seizures end. IMPRESSION:'"

REASON FOR STUDY:  Status Epilepticus INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video long-term EEG was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as alarm and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.  There is frontocentral beta seen.  No abnormal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures are performed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves/PLEDS at FP1 at 1 to 2 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording, although by the last 24 hours the frequency had diminished and they were only seen in some spurts with inter bursts of more than 10 seconds.  The morphology at the end of the recording was a lot more blunt and of lower amplitude. Generalized slow waves. SEIZURES:  During the recording, the patient would have, at the FP1 electrode, rhythmic discharges that would increase in frequency and decrease in amplitude, and then suddenly stop multiple times per hour for the first 10 hours.  Suddenly they subsided and stopped, and for the rest of the recording none were seen.  During the ones that occurred at the beginning of the recording, no clear clinical correlation was noted. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Seizures from the left prefrontal region which subsided after the first 10 hours, and none were seen for the last 50 hours of recording. Focal sharp waves/PLEDS seen in the left prefrontal region. Generalized slow waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability arising from the left prefrontal region which has a high correlation with an acute structural lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of seizures arising from the same region for the first 10 hours of the recording and none seen in the next 50 hours.  There is also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology and is likely due, at least in part, to medication effect.  These changes were noted to the primary team during the recording.\""

The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as alarm and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.  There is frontocentral beta seen.  No abnormal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures are performed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves/PLEDS at FP1 at 1 to 2 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording, although by the last 24 hours the frequency had diminished and they were only seen in some spurts with inter bursts of more than 10 seconds.  The morphology at the end of the recording was a lot more blunt and of lower amplitude. Generalized slow waves. SEIZURES:  During the recording, the patient would have, at the FP1 electrode, rhythmic discharges that would increase in frequency and decrease in amplitude, and then suddenly stop multiple times per hour for the first 10 hours.  Suddenly they subsided and stopped, and for the rest of the recording none were seen.  During the ones that occurred at the beginning of the recording, no clear clinical correlation was noted. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Seizures from the left prefrontal region which subsided after the first 10 hours, and none were seen for the last 50 hours of recording. Focal sharp waves/PLEDS seen in the left prefrontal region. Generalized slow waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability arising from the left prefrontal region which has a high correlation with an acute structural lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of seizures arising from the same region for the first 10 hours of the recording and none seen in the next 50 hours.  There is also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology and is likely due, at least in part, to medication effect.  These changes were noted to the primary team during the recording.\""

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old male with complex partial status epilepticus with seizures characterized by confusion and poor responsiveness. MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Dilantin, Topamax INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring with seizure and spike detection was preformed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is confused. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial section of the record demonstrates at the very beginning a patient who is not seizing, but has had frequent seizures prior to the hookup.  In the first several hours of recording, multiple left frontal seizures are recorded, typically lasting 1 to 3 minutes in duration.  The initial seizures are well-defined with characteristic frequency evolution.  By 6 p.m., the EEG starts to transition to a pattern with fewer seizures, but bursts of left frontal periodic delta.  An additional burst is noted at 8:45, again compatible with a late ictal pattern with buildup of activity. By 10 a.m., the patient is more awake with eye movement.  There are, however, bursts of left frontal periodic activity.  Some of these including10:37 likely demonstrate a late ictal pattern with the appearance and buildup of epileptiform activity which does demonstrate some frequency evolution.  At 11:51, the patient seems to be drifting off to sleep.  Although clinical testing is not performed, he continues to have these bursts which no longer truly evolve, but are a bit more sustained. By 2 a.m., the patient seems to be a bit more awake with more faster frequency activity.  Despite this, the same discharges continue to occur with some frequency evolution.  The discharges later in the evening or in the midnight hours may represent an ictal or postictal pattern without the same clear frequency evolution. Slow paper speed can be utilized to highlight the ongoing epileptiform pattern.  By 6 a.m., slow paper speed indicates an ongoing epileptiform pattern which no longer truly evolves and, in fact, is 1.2 Hz and 2.7 Hz periodicity.  Despite this, by 6:40 a.m. the patient is more awake, alert and interactive. HR:    90 to 100 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This EEG is diagnostic of: An ongoing status epilepticus pattern. An interesting phenomenon in that the patient does appear to be clinically improving despite the presence of epileptiform activity which has not resolved. LONG TERM MONITORING â\\x80\\x93 12/04/2012 to 12/05/2012 - #12-01 INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Continuous seizure and spike detection software is utilized. Clinically the patient is described as improving, with an improving mental status. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG provided begins at noon.  The background is relatively free of well defined complex partial seizures, but these start to re-emerge at 11:00 to 1:00 a.m.  The video is reviewed.  On some occasions prior to the seizures the patient seems to have repetitive speech and then during the discharges, he has motion arrest.  He is intermittently confused.  During examination of the patient the epileptiform activity is not so prominent. Between 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. he is moving about a bit which makes identification of the seizures more difficult, but additional seizures are noted at 4:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.  The nurse is at the bedside with him during a seizure at 5:04 a.m. on January 5, 2012.  The seizure and spike detection software continues to recognize seizures, including one at 5:06 a.m.  The nurse enters during the seizure and performs vital sign testing.  The patient is unable to answer questions.  He looks at the nurse.  He cooperates with testing, but is unable to speak. HR:    80 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING â\\x80\\x93 01/05/2012 to 01/06/2011 INTRODUCTION:  Continuous  video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This overnight EEG was recorded in several pieces. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The first section opens on the 5th at 9:32 a.m.  The patient is having left frontal focal seizures.  He stares off into space. He looks to the right.  A person comes in and it is not clear that he is particularly interactive during the seizure.  His mouth is open.  The nurses work with the patient as the seizure stops and he looks about afterwards.  The first piece of long term video EEG monitoring data primarily shows seizures in the early part of the morning.  By 1:07, the patient seems to have received medications.  Seizures again occur and are picked up by the seizure and spike detector and can be seen at 1:52.  There is a montage change to focus on the left frontal region.  Although the patient is no longer seizing in the form of a continuous seizure, there are multiple seizures per hour. This piece of EEG data concludes at 15:09 p.m. The second piece of EEG data which begins at 13:27 is not available for review.  The next available data is at midnight on the night of the 5th.  The EEG continues to demonstrate seizures from the left frontal region.  As was the case in the previous night, seizures are quite common at 1 a.m. for this individual and there is once again a pattern of almost continuous ictal activity.  This is again noted at 3 a.m.  It appears to be slowing at 6:21 a.m., but seizures recur at 6:28 and 6:37. Intermittent seizures or left frontal plebs are noted throughout the remainder of the record.  The EEG on the morning of the 6th continues to demonstrate intermittent seizures and plebs.  The patient is, however, sometimes responsive particularly when the seizures end. INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Ongoing complex partial seizures, particularly problematic between 11 and 1:00 a.m., but occurring sporadically throughout this LTM monitor.  The last seizure is at 6:17.  This remains a very highly epileptogenic focus.'"

      "text/plain": "\" CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed woman status post left MCA aneurysm repaired in 2003 with annual exacerbation of complex partial seizures and low serum levels. MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a prolonged study for a patient who appeared to have had a subclinical seizure. She was confused during the EEG and somewhat lethargic. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The background from the right hemisphere is slow and disorganized. The left hemisphere includes a high amplitude breech rhythm with a left frontal sharp and slow complex with arrhythmic delta activity. At 9:15 the patient is relatively inattentive and the technologist wraps the head. At some point essentially continuous spiking is noted in the left frontal region. A seizure is identified at 9:19 characterized by evolution of epileptiform activity in the left frontal region, which is high amplitude with a generous field of spread. The seizure duration is from 19:13:30 to 19:19:59 suggesting that this is a relatively brief seizure. The technologist transitions from this to additional recording at 09:21. After the first event with impaired responsiveness, high amplitude left frontal spiking is noted with a breech rhythm in the abnormal background. The patient's mental status actually improves somewhat. She moves about, although she is confused. The activity remains quite slow in both hemispheres. There was another brief build up again at 9:40. Artifacts are picked up at 9:35, but again there is prominent spiking in the background with very prominent epileptiform activity. A third electrographic seizure occurs at 9:58:57. The patient is relatively somnolent. Stimulation of the patient does not occur during this testing, but the seizure stops by itself and as it does the patient moves about. By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow. Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate. Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor. Her head is off the monitor. She appears to be sleepy. At  13:35 she was awake and the seizure is 12 minutes later. At 13:44 with the patient with someone at the bedside, in fact a physician examining her, the left frontal delta is prominent as are some sharp waves but she is interactive somewhat with the individual examining her. As the student leaves, the patient drifts over to the right. The electrographic seizure is at 13:47:13 and the patient is not really moving during the event but starts to reposition afterwards. This event is characterized by rhythmic, faster frequency activity in the left frontal and temporal region with also a beta accentuation. After the seizure was over, the patient looks about. HR: 78 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to: 1. Well-defined electrographic seizures noted but with only one seizure In the last 24 hours of recording. 2. Left frontotemporal focus. 3. Focal slowing from the left. 4. Generalized background slowing quite marked in the beginning of the record but better at the close of the record. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. Additional recording may be appropriate if this patient's mental status does not improve. HR: 78 bpm IMPRESSION: This section of EEG, which includes a routine 20 minute EEG, followed by 50 minutes of recording, includes multiple, brief complex partial seizures. Although the patient's mental status is abnormal, the clinical correlate for this patient's seizures includes impaired responsiveness. INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the LTM unit using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. The patient has a pattern of improving mental status over the course of the day. She, unfortunately, eliminated her EEG electrodes during the overnight recording. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the improved clinical appearance of the patient, there are electrographic seizures identified. These occur when the patient is in bed sleeping, without clinical correlate. They are associated with runs and bursts of activity. Time: 19:0838 - Approximately 1 minute in duration. Time: 19:5442 - Another seizure, maximum, in the left frontal and temporal region with a generous field of spread. Of note, the majority of the electrographic seizures are at approximately 8 p.m. and shortly thereafter the patient starts to remove the EEG electrodes. Of note, however, the patient did receive Versed in the morning and although there were frequent high amplitude left frontocentral sharp waves, the recurrence of seizures was primarily many hours afterwards. INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Electrographic seizures for this individual were well-defined with characteristic frequency evolution despite the prominent interictal sharp waves from the left frontocentral region and frontotemporal region. INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. At least one electrographic seizure is noted but no clinical seizures are observed. The patient's mental status gradually improves over the course of the record with the patient able to eat and get out of bed as well as participate in care. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections in this epoch include a markedly slow pattern with slower delta and rhythmic theta frequency from both hemispheres and high amplitude sharp and slow or spike and slow wave complexes, many of which are frontotemporal but some of which are T1. The patient is certainly much sleepier on the 6th compared to the 7th. By the morning of the 7th, she is more consistently awake, out of bed with more rhythmic theta frequency in the background although the patterns in both hemispheres are slow. Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic delta which do not have a clear clinical correlate. Seizure: The patient is in bed and she has just off the monitor.

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 6-year-old male with tonic-clonic seizures three years ago â\\x80\\x93 last seizure two years ago.  Patient now has head jerking two to three times per day.  History of ADHD and previous treatment with Dilantin. MEDICATIONS: None. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. Previous EEGs not available for comparison. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with a 10 Hz, 50 to 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm and some posterior slow waves of youth.  Prior to hyperventilation, the patient is resting comfortably.  The child has an approximately two-second spell of sitting up with head jerking and eyes opening spontaneously.  This is an extremely high voltage discharge.  It is reviewed with a sensitivity of 50 uV/mm.  At this sensitivity, there is a generalized 1.6 second burst with, by the time the entire burst is over, is almost three seconds in duration.  Using various montages, the burst is generalized, but does seem to start with poly spike and slow wave activity in the right frontal region.  It is followed by two discrete spike and slow wave complexes, which, working with different montages, are maximum in the right frontocentral/frontotemporal regions. Hyperventilation is performed, and in hyperventilation additional bursts are identified; again, very high amplitude requiring review with a sensitivity of 50 uV/mm and bursts with a spike in all likelihood reaching greater than 200 uV, with a total spike and slow wave discharge reaching amplitudes of 200 uV and greater.  The second burst in hyperventilation is of similar duration, approximately 3 seconds, and that burst is generalized in nature.  It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to start in the right frontal region. Following this, there is focal spike and slow wave activity, again picked up in the right frontocentral region with a pair of discharges, but without the sustained bursts. In regard to the brief bursts of spike and slow wave activity, which occurred in hyperventilation, the video is reviewed.  The tech indicates that the child experienced head tremor with the event that occurred in hyperventilation and in careful review of the video, it is clear that the child has a series of head tremors in association with that burst as well.  Additional clinical discharges are noted with an approximately 2-second burst at 15:50:14, and there is a series of three head jerks associated with this burst.  Isolated poly spike activity, frontally maximum but on the right with simply pairs or trios of discharges do not seem to be clinically significant.  These occur as the child is falling asleep.  There is an additional pair of bursts as the child transitions to sleep and again it is hard to see a clinical correlate for those bursts. Photic stimulation is remarkable for a photoelectric artifact, as well as some underlying driving. HR:  120 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Clinical seizures characterized by epileptiform activity with frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity with a poly spike component maximum in the frontal regions typically lasting 1.5 to 3.5 seconds in duration with one or two bursts that are longer. Underlying right frontal focus. Clinical events characterized by head bobbing, typically with three-head bobs in most of the discharges. CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the discharge is primarily a high amplitude, generalized discharge, there is clear underlying focality in this discharge.  It may be more appropriate to consider this a focal, frontal mechanism for seizures rather than a primary generalized mechanism.'"

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is described as seizing. She is on the video lying in bed. Little is identified in terms of the clinical characteristics of her seizure even though the patient is on video and she is being examined by a doctor. She seems to move the right, but not so much the left. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is experiencing a seizure characterized by repetitive sharp waves in the right temporal region superimposed upon a relatively slow background. She seems to be breathing a bit heavily and in the very beginning of the record, in this very dark recording, she seems to be looking to the left and it would be a good guess to say that she has oral automatisms. Physician comes and works with the tech as this seizure ends. Precise duration is a bit unclear, but we capture at least a minute of the seizure and then immediately afterward, sharp waves build up again first out of the right frontocentral region and then onwards toward the temporal region. The clinical team describes facial twitching. A diagnosis of focal status epilepticus is made and the epileptiform activity seems to start right frontocentral and end up right temporal. Its rich epileptiform pattern with repetitive sharp waves, sometimes fast activity and focal sharp waves which have various maximums in the frontal, central or temporal region. Ativan is given 11 minutes into the recording. Another dose is given 5 minutes later. The epileptiform activity persists, but it begins to slow down and in fact by 11:18, two minutes after the 2nd Ativan dose, the overall background is markedly slow and suppressed, particularly slow and suppressed on the left, but the sharp waves and seizures continue to build up and slow down out of the right frontocentral and right mid posterior temporal regions. At 11:2 5, the patient continues to seize although the seizures are becoming a little bit more discrete and they are starting to cluster. By 11:32, the EEG has returned pretty much to its previous pattern of more prolonged seizures and by 11:37, there are bursts of sharp waves in a record that is intermittently discontinuous on the right. This 45 minute bedside portable ICU record ends with some improvement with more discrete bursts of epileptiform activity, but the patient is basically continuing to have prominent epileptiform activity at the very end of the record, but without more sustained seizures. IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION: Focal status epilepticus.'"

There is a 9 to 10 Hz, 75 to 100 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Soon after the recording began, a repetitive sharp wave activity was seen in the left hemisphere (F3/C3). As the recording continued, the child became drowsy with and then had a seizure.  On the EEG, it started from the left central area by sharp wave activity.  After 1Â½ seconds, it abruptly generalized with 3 Hz spike and wave activity.  This lasted for 40 seconds and stopped abruptly.  During the episode, the child was observed to be blinking her eyelids at the same rhythm of 3 Hz and stopped blinking when the EEG discharges stopped. Nine seizures were recorded during this EEG tracing and 8 of 9 started in the left central region with sharp and wave activity one to two seconds before abrupt generalized 3 Hz.   One seizure seemed to be abrupt in onset in the right hemisphere and then immediately generalized to 3 Hz activity.  The generalized spike and wave  activity is 3-4 Hz  in the beginning and a little slower (less than 3) at the end of the seizure, with eye blinking as a clinical finding. HR:  126 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. 9 seizure, 8 of which emanate from the left hemisphere. Left central sharp and slow activity. 3 Hz sharp/ slow wave activity.

Patient was admitted to hospital 10/07/06. MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, Ibuprofen. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The overall background is somewhat disorganized for age.  In this sharply contoured background, in the waking record, there is a subtle underlying approximately 3 Hz spike and wave activity. Features of sleep include rhythmic background slowing, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and an increase in beta activity. The major abnormalities are seizures, the first of which occurs just prior to the start of 3 Hz photic stimulation.  The seizure is characterized by very high amplitude, frontally predominant 3.5 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  The seizure begins just as the tech starts photic stimulation.  The child is able to sit up when the tech calls his name, but he is not able to respond and motions after the discharge is over that he does not recall the code word.  A second discharge is identified, which begins during photic stimulation at 19 Hz and slightly outlasts the duration of the photic stimulation, with a total seizure duration of 18 seconds, again with high amplitude, symmetric frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.  Photic stimulation is repeated, but additional seizures are not recorded. HR:  84 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Two clinical seizures characterized by frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity with clinical impairment of awareness. The interictal EEG demonstrates an occipitally predominant spike and slow wave discharge. Mild degree of background disorganization. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Ativan. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has multiple events, some of which are identified by the family and some of which are subclinical. FIRST EVENT, TIME 17:10 to 17:12:43:  The patient is sleeping. He extends his right arm.  His daughter observes the seizure and rushes to press the alarm button.  The patient is partially under the covers and other motor features are not identifiable.  Testing determines that he is not responsive at 17:11:43. The EEG is partially obscured by muscle and movement, but there is the appearance of rhythmic, paroxysmal, sharply contoured beta activity in the background. SECOND EVENT, TIME 19:28:48:  The patient is sleeping.  Again, the precise scalp correlates are partly obscured by muscle and movement as the patient is moving under the covers.  Clear paroxysmal frequency evolution with rhythmic, sharply contoured 4 Hz activity maximum in the frontocentral regions is identified.  The seizure ends at 19:31:32. THIRD EVENT, TIME 21:31:42: The patient is awake, talking to a nurse.  He elevates his arm and becomes poorly responsive.  This EEG demonstrates more alpha frequency activity, which comes from the right frontocentral region.  He has psychomotor slowing and by 21:31:58 he has right arm extension and right gaze deviation.  The EEG activity is maximum in the right frontocentral region with alpha frequency activity and by 21:32:14, the repetitive, slower sharp and slow wave frequencies can be seen particularly in the midline and right frontocentral region.  The nurse starts to speak to the patient at 21:32:28 and she has been doing activities at the bedside which caused her to look away from the patient rather than at the patient and as the recording continues, she begins to realize that the patient is having a seizure at 21:32:44 when she pushes the alarm bell.  The seizure ends at 21:34:13, as the frequency evolution slows.  The EEG activity continues to slow with slow spike and wave activity, which is maximum in the frontal regions although generalized towards the close of the seizure. SERIES OF PUSH BUTTON EVENTS  9? :37: The patient is drowsy in the room.  No clinical seizures are seen. He seems to be falling asleep holding the seizure alarm.  Check  for exact time RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The background EEG demonstrates rhythmic background theta in wakefulness with focal slowing and sharply contoured activity from the right frontocentral regions. Long-Term Monitoring, 1/28/04 to 1/29/04 INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the EEG monitoring unit. Subtle seizures are identified as well as subclinical seizures.  During this portion of the record, the patient receives Phenobarbital and Phenytoin. FIRST SEIZURE EVENT 10:31:06: The patient is resting comfortably in the bed with the lights off.  The background demonstrates a focal slowing from the right frontocentral region.  The first change is probably at 10:31:06 with some arrhythmic slowing followed by high amplitude faster frequency activity.  While there seems to be some muscle, there is clearly alpha frequency activity for approximately 15 seconds in the frontal regions, left greater than right, and then frequency evolution.  In this event, the patient has no motor signs, and he has no eye movement until 10:31:51.  The seizure is clearly over with a previous baseline seen at 10:33:16. SECOND SEIZURE EVENT 10:56:45: The patient is alone in his room.  No clinical signs are seen, but there is alpha frequency activity, as well as muscle.  The alpha frequency activity is picked up in the left frontocentral region but is seen bilaterally.  This activity continues to evolve with faster frequency activity from the right frontocentral region as well as rhythmic slowing seen in the posterior region and some asymmetry, faster on the left than the right.  By 10:57:27, high amplitude spike and slow wave activity can be seen despite the muscle and movement artifact from the right frontal region.  At 10:57:36, the patient lifts the left hand in a somewhat automatic fashion. By 10:57:45, he looks to the right.  The activity continues to evolve, maximum in the left hemisphere and the frontocentral regions with a generous field of spread, but there is clear slowing from the right hemisphere.  The arm elevates at 10:58:05.  When the team comes to test the patient, a few minutes later, the patient is initially postictal.  He is tested at 10:59:15 when he is slow to arouse, but then answers questions appropriately.  By the time the physicians walk in to test the patient, the seizure is over.  The physicians walk in just in the last five seconds of the seizure.  Within 20 seconds or so his responsiveness improves. SLEEP TIME, 5:40 AM: The seizures slow down.  By 5:40 AM, the EEG shows a pattern with generous beta frequency activity.  A seizure occurs out of sleep at 5:51:41 with little in the way of clinical signs.  There is high amplitude frequency evolution with the characteristic pattern of theta and alpha frequency activity and then slowing.  The seizures ends at 5:41:31.  The seizure emanates from stage II sleep and afterwards the patient has a brief arousal and then goes back to sleep. Features of sleep include the beta activity, focal slowing, and occasional sharp waves, as well as a breach from the left frontal region. SEIZURE, TIME 04:29:28: The patient is asleep.  He is leaning on his right side.  At 4:29:19, as the EEG begins to show rhythmic alpha and theta frequency activity maximum from the left central region, but with some generalization, the patient lifts his fingers up and extends them. He had been asleep and the activity might appear as some form of a purposeful automatism.  The alarm bell is heard to be rung at 4:29:39.  The EEG shows rhythmic theta frequency evolution. The rhythmic theta frequency activity continues at 4:30:34 with characteristic frequency evolution, faster frequency activity persisting in the frontal regions on the left, and begins to slow in the other regions of the brain.  This seizure has a similar pattern to other seizures in that the paroxysmal activity wanes, but there remains some fast activity in the right frontal region at 4:31:58, which gradually abates.  The EEG seems to have returned to the background at 04:33.'"

LAMBDA activity is seen as is central MU.  In some cases the LAMBDA is somewhat asymmetric. The major abnormality in this record is absence seizures characterized by bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude frontally predominant 3.5 to 5 Hz spike and wave activity with discharges lasting up to 10 seconds.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing opens the child is awake. There is a low voltage, featureless background. At 11:51:48 while the technologist is touching the patient, the patient seems to have a subclinical seizure which persists even after the technologist stops touching the patient. The seizure evolves with rhythmic ictal activity which is approximately  2.5 Hz maximum on the right. By 11:52:01 it is bilateral. It demonstrates frequency evolution  which is similar to the child's heart rate which is 150 but it gradually is slowing by 11:54. The seizure ends at 11:54:45 and is overall flattened. The overall background is low voltage and suppressed with some artifact PICC line up in the left frontal region which is alpha frequency activity and matches an extra cerebral artifact. By 12:00 the activity is not quite as suppressed. Seizure #2 occurs at 12:02:45 with the appearance of very subtle rhythmic activity which in this case is seen a little bit more prominently in the left central electrodes with a double phase reversal, but clear frequency evolution and a negativity at T2. This activity demonstrates frequency evolution. This one again starting C3-T1 with this funny field at T1-T2 and then this seizure clearly evolves out of the left but the pattern is similar to the first seizure with frequency evolution, gradually building faster than the patient's heart rate at 12:03:15. Behaviorally the only manifestation observed is that the child blinks but not at the same rate as the ictal activity. By 12:03:52 the activity is bilateral. This seizure starts to abate at 12:05:11 and is over 10 seconds later. The background  activity is suppressed. A third occurs at 12:10:42.

She has automatisms  of the right hand and left arm with head turning, first to the left and then to the right. It is more of a dystonic posture of the left hand and the automatism in on the right, but she started out with her hands in that posture. She has a circling movement of the right hand, automatic slightly circular movements of the mouth, hands and legs. She answers the tech when the tech asks \"Are you okay?\" She appears unable to speak to the tech during the later parts of the seizure, but she is interestingly responsive. By this point, late in the seizure, the EEG is very difficult to interpret. After the burst of muscle when she starts fiddling about, there are bursts of frontal delta. The seizure seems to be over at 13:59:27 for a total seizure duration of 2 minutes 10 seconds. The end of the seizure is bilateral, but the early portions of the seizure are exquisitely focal in nature with this train of repetitive left temporal sharp wave and then automatic behavior. Interestingly, for a patient with a left temporal seizure, she was initially unresponsive to the tech, but then later in the seizure actually was confused and could not speak but seemed to interact with the tech. Photic stimulation was performed at the close of the record. HR: \\t90 bpm IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to: 1.   A left temporal lobe seizure. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related mechanism.'"

MEDICATIONS: INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory routine 20-minute EEG with photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Impedances were satisfactory. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Mu activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Frequent eye blink artifact was noted.  Despite the eye blink artifact, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a subtle, infrequent, slowing noted in the left mid temporal region, maximum at T3-T1 and there are rare, medium amplitude left anterior sharp waves.  Some of these have a 5 hertz component, but they are associated with a subtle underlying focal slowing.  As the patient becomes drowsier, there is also some rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness noted from either side. Deeper stages of sleep include an increase in Synchronicity of the background. Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving. Heart rate 100 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to: Subtle, infrequent, left temporal focal slowing. In the context of multiple normal variants, there are rare, left anterior temporal sharp waves or mid temporal sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  If there is any question, a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep could be of value. S'"

Medications:\\tPHENOBARBITAL,  VIMPAT, DEPACON Sedation: EEG Type:\\tAwake & asleep, portable Technique:\\tInternational 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, obtunded Description: There is no AP gradient and no PDR.  There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of polymorphic theta and delta activity with underriding excess beta activity.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of theta<delta activity.  Some symmetrical sleep spindles and vertex waves (better visualized over the right) are captured. A single left prefrontal (Fp1) electrographic seizure lasting ~80 seconds is captured. It commences with rhythmic Fp1sharply contoured theta activity that increases in amplitude with limited spread/reflection over Fp2 electrode.  There was no clinical correlate associated to this EEG activity. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84. Summary of Findings: Seizure, single, electrographic, left frontal Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric Breach artifact, right hemispheric Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute awake and asleep EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, continuous focal left hemispheric slowing and a single ~ 80 seconds very focal left frontal seizure that was confined to a single electrode. Diffuse slowing indicates diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically non-specific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  There is an epileptogenic focus over the left frontal region.  Breach artifact is secondary to a skull defect.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.'"

MEDICATIONS:  Not recorded at the start of the test, phenobarbital, others. INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  This is a somewhat challenging, portable record and the patient has had difficulty cooperating. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and lacks the typical developmental milestones that one would expect for an adult of this age.  The overall pattern is chaotic.  There are bursts of frontally predominant high amplitude delta noted.  Some of this activity is notched.  In addition, there are occasional frontal sharp waves, seen at the midline, occasionally maximum somewhat to the right.  Paroxysmal higher amplitude rhythmic theta activity was noted, but without a definitive spike and wave complex.  In addition, there is more posteriorly predominant, 5-7 Hz activity noted in the background, which is paroxysmal, more resembling in the interictal discharge in a normal pattern. The patient has some with twitching and some grimacing.  It is difficult to attribute these to the multiple epileptiform discharges noted above. As the patient begins to drift off to sleep at the end of the EEG, the overall background is little bit more monomorphic, lacking some of the epileptiform discharges described above.  Following this, there is some more remarkable left more than right theta, but overall this is a bihemispheric pattern. Heart rate 96 bpm. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal 1-hour EEG due to: Markedly abnormal background. Multiple epileptiform abnormalities some of which are subtle and includes slow spike and wave activity, paroxysmal frontal delta, isolated frontal sharp waves, and likely the rhythmic theta described above. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This pattern is known common in the context of a Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.  It is difficult to attribute this patient's behaviors to the specific EEG findings described above.  The grimacing and twitching does not appear to be a seizure, but that behavior was not described as 1 of her 16 seizures today.\""

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and it includes multiple different patterns, some of which do not consistently carry clinical correlate of clinical seizure.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There is no seizure log, no report of medications, and overall no clinical history was provided.  The patient is observed to be able to move her arm. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is apparently awake, trached in the ICU.  She is able to move one arm.  The EEG demonstrates a pattern of low voltage theta and delta from the left with frequent right temporal sharp and slow wave complexes, which demonstrate a subtle evolution.  At times, they are periodic and at times there is background suppression from the right or in a generalized fashion, last seen up to two seconds. There are events characterized by movement of the left arm. #1 â\\x80\\x93 9:32:42 â\\x80\\x93 The EEG demonstrates the preexisting pattern of right temporal sharp activity with in fact less in the way of frequency evolution in comparison to the other portions of the record.  The nurses push the button for this same activity at 15:04 and 15:27.  Upon reviewing the video for these events, no change in the patientâ\\x80\\x99s clinical status can be identified and movement of the left arm canâ\\x80\\x99t be identified in the video. #2 â\\x80\\x93 16:15 â\\x80\\x93 At this time, an identical event such as that described above is seen.  The background EEG is much more suppressed and there is frequent poly spike and spike and slow wave activity but not significantly different than the other portions of the record. Although there is no report of CNS-acting medications, by 16:19:05 the background EEG is becoming increasingly suppressed.  The background from the left is low voltage with a mixture of delta and theta.  From the right, there are ongoing spike and slow wave, poly spike and slow wave discharges, periodic activity, and less in the way of frequency evolution.  This is followed by increasing quantities of fast activity particularly in the frontal regions. #3 â\\x80\\x93 17:40 â\\x80\\x93 The nurse is at the bedside.  The patient seems to make eye contact with the nurse at this time.  There is again frequent spike and slow wave activity from the right hemisphere that is seen almost continuously. #4 â\\x80\\x93 22:39:19 â\\x80\\x93 There is less in the way of epileptiform activity in the background and the background is lower voltage and more continuous.  This pattern is again identified between 1:00 and 2:00 AM.  There is a pause in the record between 1:51 AM and 10:31, but the EEG at the close of the record is low voltage with ongoing spike and slow wave activity from the right hemisphere, maximum in the mid-to-anterior temporal region with a generous field of spread. HR:  96 BPM. IMPRESSION: This 24-hour section of the record is abnormal due to: Ongoing epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere, sometimes with frequency evolution. Significant variability in the record with some portions of the record showing more discontinuity and more beta frequency activity, suggestive of administration of CNS medications. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The clinical behaviors were not associated with a significant change in the amount of epileptiform activity in the record.  The epileptiform activity seen in the record is compatible with a late, status epilepticus pattern.'"

MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Lovenox, Percocet, Tylenol INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a rhythmic mixture of delta and theta frequency activity. There is a frontally predominant periodic complex which is asynchronous. The field for the discharge is unusual and in the right frontal region, it has an anterior to posterior lag as a triphasic wave might have, but is not identical in the left hemisphere and using an average reference, it is most prominent in the frontal regions FP1 and FP2 with an anterior to posterior lag. In some cases, it is maximum at FP1, clearly higher amplitude and on other occasions, a bit more prominent at FP2. Initially, stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle. Ativan is given during the EEG and produces a slowing of the background. After the Ativan, the periodic activity begins to abate and is most prominent in the right frontal region. At 12:23:40, the periodic activity to abruptly terminates and the EEG transitions to a alpha theta background. Following the Ativan the EEG was improved dramatically. HR: 76 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Marked background slowing. 2. Triphasic waves 3. Complex periodic activity some of which appears to be epileptiform in nature, but others which are more focal and have unusual morphology. CLINICAL CORRELATION: Features of this record support a metabolic encephalopathy, however, the dramatic improvement with the use of benzodiazepine suggest that the discharges are more likely to represent a late form of status epilepticus.'"

Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.  During the first 24 hours of the record, no clinical events were noted by the patient, nursing staff, or seizure and spike detection software. Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity, stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS. In the transition to sleep or in drowsiness, focal slowing can be identified in the left mid temporal region, typically maximum in the T1-T3 electrodes.  This is best visualized and with a slower paper speed.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS are noted in stage 2 sleep.  Likely, slow wave sleep was noted in the early morning hours on the 23rd. Seizures:  None. Epileptiform Detections:  Primarily in sleep, sharp waves and spikes are noted from the left temporal region.  They can be differentiated from EKG artifact and may be maximum at T1-T3 and occasionally have some spread to T5.  Generally, high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes are noted, drowsiness, stage 2 sleep, and even as the patient transitions towards slow wave sleep. Heart rate:  84 BPM. IMPRESSION:  This first 24 hours of continuous video EEG monitoring is remarkable for: High amplitude left anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes, some with variable maximum involving the posterior temporal region. Rhythmic left temporal slowing, less prominent noted in the baseline. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG suggests a focal mechanism for epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Labetalol, Morphine, and Propofol drip.  INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very slow delta background with smaller amounts of theta.  Despite the breach with accentuation of theta from the right, in the initial portions of the record, there is very slow, sharply contoured periodic delta at O2/T6/P4 with a periodicity of 0.45 to 0.75.  Although there is no mention during the record of changes in the patientâ\\x80\\x99s medications, the periodic delta becomes less high amplitude and less sharply contoured with the treatments that are initiated.  The overall background remains continuous with again the identifiable breach and a pattern primarily of slow delta.  There is a clear change in the pattern at 2:00 AM and at this time in the record, although there is some artifact particularly at the C3 electrode, there is an increase in 4 Hz activity from the right hemisphere and an overall improvement in the overall background.  In addition, the periodic activity has improved dramatically.   As the recording continues, the theta frequency activity is more prominent in the right central parietal regions, and there is a right central sharp wave seen in the setting of the breach rhythm.  Sampling at 6:00 AM again shows that the very slow periodic delta from the right posterior quadrant has resolved and there are occasional right frontocentral sharp waves seen in primarily a theta frequency background.  By 8:23 AM, some of that very slow periodic delta activity has begun to reappear and towards the close of the sampling, that activity seems to be maximal in the right frontocentral region.   HR:  120 BPM. \\tIMPRESSION: Overall, initial improvement not all of which was sustained in this EEG with a treatment of Propofol with the disappearance of slow, periodic activity in the right posterior region, with a very large field of spread to faster frequency activity.    CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG may represent a subtle form of status epilepticus with improvement with the use of benzodiazepine.  Of note, however, the activity seen in the right occipital region was beginning to reappear in the right frontal region by the close of the record.   Compared to a previous study, the previous study identified a ventilator artifact, which had a different appearance and had a different periodicity of 0.58 to 0.6 Hz.  That activity didnâ\\x80\\x99t localize and had a periodicity much more compatible with an artifact.  '"

Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.

Mother states that she continues to have staring spells, most recently 1 month ago.  Placed on Depo-Provera 3 weeks ago, but found to be 5 weeks pregnant with abdominal pain and nausea. MEDICATIONS:  Zarontin, lamotrigine, and prenatal vitamins. INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory study.  This patient had multiple electrographic discharges with clinical impairment of awareness identified with some. Hyperventilation was deferred. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified.  The waking background includes generous beta as well as some theta in the occipital regions.  In wakefulness, an occipital spike and slow wave complex was noted of 3-4 hertz.  The spike may be bilateral or more prominent in the right or left occipital region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in theta.  Lambda was noted in wakefulness with POSTS noted in sleep. Epileptiform abnormalities include occipital 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity, which may be unilateral or bilateral.  In this relatively high amplitude record, there is some underlying theta noted. Seizures: This patient had between 15 and 18 electrographic discharges, which are 3-5 hertz in nature.  They are generalized with some variability in terms of maxima, some seem to have maximum in the right frontal or occipital regions, other at Pz, and others are more clearly a generalized pattern.  They occur as the patient is drifting off to sleep; early stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Most discharges are either 7-10 seconds or 17-20 seconds duration.  The technologist performs testing.  The technologist attempts to perform testing early on in the discharges, but arouses the patient approximately 5-7 seconds in the discharge and stimulation of the patient does appear to terminate the discharges.  In the longer bursts, the technologist is able to demonstrate that the patient is not aware that she has had an event and the patient stated that she was sleeping even during the events in which she was awake.  Towards the close of the EEG, the events are starting to occur out of stage 2 sleep and then again with auditory stimulation the patient alerts. Very limited photic stimulation was completed: a driving response was noted. Heart rate 90 bpm. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Multiple bursts of 3-5 hertz spike and wave activity of 7-10 seconds in duration with variable maxima and variable onset. Some are clearly clinical seizures Rhythmic theta prior to the spike and wave activity. Occipital spike and slow wave complexes. Posterior theta. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no previous EEGs for comparison.  This EEG suggests a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  There are many atypical features noted in this record and a consideration for an atypical absence or secondary generalized process is appropriate.'"

The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontal central beta.

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal video EEG monitoring study with no interictal epileptiform abnormalities.  Patient had 1 event consisting of right arm shaking for a few seconds with no change in mental status.  There were no associated ictal changes on EEG. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This video EEG monitoring does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If all of the patient's habitual events have not been captured, a repeat video EEG monitoring may be helpful.\""

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.

No activating procedures were performed.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  At times during the recording, the patient becomes aroused and there is diffuse muscle artifact and there is an increase in the frequency of the recording to more of a theta pattern with a more frontal beta rhythm for seconds.

      "text/plain": "\" CLINICAL HISTORY:  19 year old right handed male with epilepsy MEDICATIONS:  Depakote. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient had a seizure during the EEG and removed all of the electrodes which were difficult to replace in the immediate postictal period. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz, 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm. Brief drowsiness is characterized by the appearance of background theta.  In the initial sections of the EEG the patient demonstrates bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant 3-6 Hz spike and wave activity of 1 to 3 seconds duration.  When testing can be performed during the bursts, initially the patient is able to repeat after a 3 second burst, but in later sections during hyperventilation with a 5 second burst he does not recall a code word.  The bursts are high amplitude symmetric spike and wave complexes with an after going slow wave.  Hyperventilation was stopped at 3:34:27, 168 seconds into the initiation, simply because the patient stopped hyperventilating and then he was reminded to hyperventilate again at 3:34:35.  During hyperventilation there was clear accentuation of spike and wave activity.  In addition, after a burst of spike and wave activity, there was rhythmic 4-5 Hz activity which was a bit more prominent on the right compared to the left.  This was followed again by a generalized spike and wave discharge.  Brief spike and wave discharges were not associated with impairment of awareness, but those that were 3 to 5 seconds in duration were associated with impairment of duration. Hyperventilation was initiated at 3:31:43 which clearly accentuated the generalized spike and wave activity.  Increasing bursts of spike and wave activity were observed with increasing duration. SEIZURE:  3:32:03  the patient demonstrates increasing bursts of spike and wave activity.  At 3:32:47 he is unable to repeat a phrase.  The EEG returns to normal after 5 seconds. At 3:33:51 the patient demonstrates a brief spike and wave discharge. At 3:35:14 there is a spike and wave discharge which ends with background theta and then a second at 3:35:24, but after that discharge there seems to be more rhythmic theta out of the right hemisphere for a few seconds, then a spike and wave discharge, and then a subtle asymmetry with the appearance of more theta out of the right hemisphere compared to the left.  The patient is behaviorally motionless, but he has stopped hyperventilating and appears to be poorly responsive, although no involuntary movements are noted.  For 20 seconds, the patient demonstrates no positive motor activity, but high amplitude, spike and wave activity is noted in a background with prominent disruption of faster frequency activity and prominent, background delta. The EEG transforms at 03:36:02 with the appearance of 9-16 Hz fast activity.  Behaviorally the patient transitions to a tonoclonic seizure with extension of both hands and then tonic and then clonic activity.  His head turns to the left initially and then as his activity switches to more of a clonic component he moves over to the left and nearly falls out of the chair.  As he does so, his EEG electrodes become loose.  The last seconds of the EEG demonstrated a pattern of fast activity both 9 Hz activity and some beta. The clonic activity is seen at 03:36:13 and the seizure is over at 03:37:00 for a seizure that was approximately 1.5 minutes.  The patient demonstrated prolonged postictal changes. HR:    60 to 90 bpm IMPRESSION:  This EEG is diagnostic of epilepsy with what appeared to be a generalized seizure and generalized spike and wave activity. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The majority of the features noted in this EEG is suggesting generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  Of note, as the EEG transitioned from interictal phenomenon with spike and wave activity to the clinical seizure with motion arrest, there was some focality with rhythmic theta observed out of the right hemisphere.  This may suggest more than one contributed to the pathogenesis of this patient's epilepsy.\""

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy and confusion.  No activating procedures were performed.   Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and nurses' notes as well as patient alarms were used to review the EEG. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the last 8 hours of the recording, there was multiple electrode artifact as they were detached. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record remains without background which has a very seldom posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7-8 Hz.  There are no activating procedures and there is some frontal central beta seen.  Overall, however, is mainly diffusely slow and a theta 5-7 Hz frequency.  Some sleep architecture can be seen. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves seen continuously at T5 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz in a monomorphic fashion consistent with periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). Focal slow waves are seen over the left hemisphere, maximal at T5 continuously throughout the recording at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts. Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz is seen throughout the recording continuously. SEIZURES:  The patient had multiple electrographic seizures that would appear to arise from the left hemisphere, maximally over the posterior temporal region at T5 intervals and a delta rhythmic discharge that increases in frequency and amplitude and becomes better formed until it suddenly stops.  This first seizure occurred at 10:43:18 a.m. and ended at 10:45 a.m. A second similar seizure occurred at 4:21:57 p.m. and ended at 4:25:51 p.m. and the last seizure occurred around 10:50 p.m.  At that point, multiple electrodes had been lost which made it difficult to evaluate the origin of the seizure but appeared to be similar to the other ones.  Please note that during none of these seizures there appeared to be a clinical correlate. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to left hemispheric seizures arising possibly from the left posterior temporal region in addition to left posterior temporal periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges and focal slow waves in addition to generalized slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with multiple seizures arising from the left hemisphere, likely posterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of acute structural  in the left posterior temporal region.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video continuous EEG monitoring performed according to the standard 10-20 EEG system and a single additional EKG electrode.  Automatic spike detection and seizure detection programs were implemented.  Nursing notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.  This study was reviewed intermittently by an attending physician on several occasions. Approximately 14 hours, from approximately 5:00 p.m. on 09/13/2012 until approximately 7:00 a.m. on 09/14/2012. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a right to left interhemispheric asymmetry.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude mixture of alpha and theta activities with under-riding faster frequencies.  During maximal wakefulness, very weak anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is observed over the right hemisphere.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and alpha as well as delta activity with under-riding faster frequencies.  There is no clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient observed over the left hemisphere.  Additional continuous polymorphic delta activity is observed over the left lateral leads, as well as left frontal leads.  Brief fragmented sleep is captured.  There is asymmetry of sleep architecture with better formed sleep spindles and vertex waves over the right hemisphere.  There are frequent episodes of abnormal independent right upper extremity and left upper extremity activity.  Episodes of right upper extremity activity are described as right upper extremity posturing flexion followed by brief right upper extremity and shoulder jerk.  Left upper extremity episodes are described as brief shaking of left upper extremity and jerks at the left shoulder.  These episodes are more pronounced during wakefulness and periods of agitation.  If the patient is asleep, episodes of right upper extremity posturing/flexion would wake him up.  There is no abnormal EEG correlate with any of these episodes.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 65-year-old man with history of cardiac rest status post prolonged CPR now with diffuse myoclonus concerning for status epilepticus. MEDICATIONS:  Valproic acid, lorazepam and 4 mg vecuronium given during the EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient, Until approximately 10 minutes into the recording the EEG consists of high amplitude diffuse irregular EMG artifact with frequent brief periods of discontinuity. At approximately 8 minutes into the recording, 4 mg of vecuronium is administered.  Approximately 10 minutes into the recording, EMG artifact disappears.  Once EMG artifact is cleared, the background consists of low to moderate amplitude, generalized frontally predominant, spikes and poly spikes with after-going slow waves that occur at approximately 1.5 to 4 Hz.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. During this recording, the patient has seizures at 1616, 1834, 01 :24:11, and 05:14:52. DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal with excess beta and theta. It is difficult to find a well-defined alpha rhythm. Prominent rhythmic theta is noted in the right temporal or occipital region and there are sharp waves noted. Sleep is characterized by an increase in beta with spindles and arrhythmic delta activity. Sharp waves on this EEG can be posterior, right occipital, anterior temporal or even on one or two occasions right frontal. Epileptiform activity is accentuated in sleep and some of it has a bifrontal or more generalized appearance. There are clear stage 2 sleep morphologies. Stage 2 sleep also is associated with some generalized, bifrontal spike and slow wave or polyspike complexes. Seizure number one 16:16:26. The patient is with his mother. He is asleep. In sleep, there is repetitive spiking noted from the right mid to posterior temporal region. The patient starts to stir from sleep at 16:14:50 and he looks at his mother, which produces an increase in muscle in the background. He looks about for several seconds and he speaks to his mother, although it is difficult to tell what he said. He gestures with his left hand, puts the left hand to the mouth and looks about. Behaviorally, this seems to be an aura because he does not seem to be having any clinical symptoms and then his mother goes to get the urinal. No clinical manifestations are noted aside from tremulousness and an urge to go to the bathroom. However, as the patient gets up to go to the bathroom, he starts to have jerking at 16:16:30 with jerking, vocalizations and tremulousness. He holds the left hand a bit more still and jerks the right hand He also has characteristic ictal-type respirations. The primary features of this seizure include restlessness. By 17:36, he is able to answer questions. Behaviorally, the seizure is primarily characterized by abnormal respirations and agitation. Seizure time 18:34:54. The patient has been resting in bed. He is dozing. Again, he sits up abruptly, moves about, breathes rapidly and is briefly agitated. This seizure ends at 18:35:36 and he has automatisms and gestures, is confused and tries to take off the electrodes at 18:35:47. By EEG, this is a somewhat challenging EEG to localize because of the high amplitude activity and the muscle artifact. The epileptiform activity prior to this seizure is right posterior temporal and, during the seizure, very difficult to localize in part because of the muscle artifact. There is a clear postictal change. Seizure time 23:44 is just a push button event. Seizure time 01:23:40. The patient has been asleep with a focal slowing in sharp waves seen in the right occipital and posterior region. Muscle artifact is seen at 01 :23:49. He sits up, has the characteristic respirations, is a bit agitated and tremulous. He starts to take off the blood pressure cuff and the covers. He has midline, fearful movements as were seen in the previous seizure. The technologist, nurse or the patient pushes the button at 1 :24:13, it is a little hard to tell and the nurse is at the bedside with him. Somebody asked him are you okay or asked the nurse if she is okay at 01:24:27. The nurse, at 01 :24:35, touched the patient and asked the patient is he okay. The seizure seemed to be ending at 01 :24:36. The patient rests comfortably. Seizure time 05:14:28. The patient has been sleeping. Wakes from sleep with muscle artifact, sits up. Again, he seems to be upset and agitated. The EEG during the seizure is difficult to interpret. He seems to be postictal and confused by 05:16:30 and then consolable. Heart rate N/ A. IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional EEG recording will follow in subsequent days and the final impression and clinical correlation will follow.'"

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Glucosamine, Keppra INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient reports no seizures during this section of the record. None are identified by the clinical team. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a medium amplitude background. The overall waking record is relatively well-organized particularly in the morning of 9/14/2010. The record continues to demonstrate right occipital sharp waves and spike waves, occasional bifrontal sharp waves and fewer right anterior temporal sharp waves and fewer right anterior temporal sharp waves. Trains of sharp waves are noted at 8:16 in the morning on 9/14/2010, but are asymptomatic and the patient is conversant. HR: 80 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING 09/15/2010 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: On the 15th, he has frequent, right anterior temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes. He also has some frontal sharp and slow wave complexes which are bilateral and more remarkable on the left. There are sections of the record including where he has trains of right occipital sharp waves. Seizure Time: 09:32. The patient is in bed. At 09:32:30, he has repetitive spiking from the occipital regions most prominent in the 02 distribution. The spiking is essentially at 5 hertz. At 9:32:38, he has stiffening which his mother is instantly aware of and reaches for the push button. Behavioral aspects of the seizures include lack of movement on the left and tremulousness on the right with coarse respirations. This clinical seizure progresses at 9:33 to tonic clonic activity with focalization just prior to this. The EEG pattern is a tonic clonic pattern and the jerking is slightly asynchronous right shoulder more so than the left. This is a very difficult seizure to localize because of activity and the activity is clearly bilateral by 09:33:18, but it looks like early in his seizure, it may transition from occipital to anterior temporal. The physician comes in at 09:34. By that point, the EEG is transitioning to postictal state. The patient remains tremulous at the end of the seizure. There is some rhythmic activity picked up on the left parasagittal region including the left occipital, but the activity seems to have abated on the right and the right has transitioned to a more of a slow pattern. The patient is postictal, but conversant at 09:36:38. Additional recording demonstrates a drowsy pattern as the patient drifts off to sleep. The patient did not receive benzodiazepines. By October 14, 2010 the patient is awake and in fact this section of the record is one of the best organized sections of the record with a discernible alpha rhythm I observed on both sides. HR: 120 bpm, with the seizure. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG monitoring due to: 1. Epileptiform activity in the right occipital region sometimes occurring in trains without clear clinical correlate. 2. Right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes sometimes seen infrequently, but again at other times seen in bursts and trains almost as If the patient is having some clinical seizures. 3.

Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing. During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. Detections were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored.

Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing. During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. Detections were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored.

Patient is admitted to continuous audio-video EEG monitoring for localization, lateralization of patient\\'s seizures as a part of presurgical evaluation for a potential epilepsy surgery. Seizure onset in 2004. Epilepsy Risk Factors: No complications during birth. Denies a family history of seizures, history of head trauma, previous CNS infection, febrile seizures or developmental delay. When he was 2 year old he had a high fever with a convulsion he was told he had meningitis. Seizure type: No aura. 100% during sleep. He has a tonic clonic shaking. After the event tired for hours and headaches. Has had tongue biting and urinary incontinence. Seizure type 2: Has episodes of right leg shaking for seconds almost daily at night while asleep. Seizure type 3: He has been having episodes of mouth movement and lip smacking with closed eyes for 1-2 minutes some with right arm up in the air with the hand in a fist. Afterward he is tired and sleeps for hours. Last seizure in 1/2015. Current AEDs: Depakote ER 250mg-500mg Lamictal 150mg -150mg Previous AEDs: CBZ 250mg Lamictal Dilantin caused gingival issues. Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing. During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. Detections were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored.

Seizure onset in 2004. Epilepsy Risk Factors: No complications during birth. Denies a family history of seizures, history of head trauma, previous CNS infection, febrile seizures or developmental delay. When he was 2 year old he had a high fever with a convulsion he was told he had meningitis. Seizure type: No aura. 100% during sleep. He has a tonic clonic shaking. After the event tired for hours and headaches. Has had tongue biting and urinary incontinence. Seizure type 2: Has episodes of right leg shaking for seconds almost daily at night while asleep. Seizure type 3: He has been having episodes of mouth movement and lip smacking with closed eyes for 1-2 minutes some with right arm up in the air with the hand in a fist. Afterward he is tired and sleeps for hours. Last seizure in 1/2015. Current AEDs: Depakote ER 250mg-500mg Lamictal 150mg -150mg Previous AEDs: CBZ 250mg Lamictal Dilantin caused gingival issues. Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.

Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing. During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. Detections were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of epilepsy since age 11.  Her seizures occur more frequently now and are largely nocturnal. MEDICATIONS:  Diazepam, divalproex and zonisamide. INTRODUCTION:  __________ DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens, there is a well-formed and symmetric 9 to 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of frontocentral beta activity identified which is symmetrically distributed.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by attenuation and fragmentation of the existing posterior dominant rhythm and the appearance of central theta activity.  Stage 2 sleep is not appreciated. On at least 4 occasions during the record, there is the appearance of spike and wave discharges.  On at least 2 of these occasions, the discharges appear generalized with a bifrontal maximum.  These appear during periods of light drowsiness.  For approximately 3 to 4 seconds, there is a disruption of the background and the appearance of bihemispheric slowing superimposed upon which there is a sharply contoured activity.  There is, however, a definitive bifrontal generalized spike.  Later in the recording, there is a similar brief background slowing, and there is again bifrontal generalized spike and wave discharges.  These discharges are singleton events and thus it is difficult to determine what their frequency is.  On the third appearance, the spike wave discharges appears predominantly over the left frontal region and is maximal at FT7.  This discharge has the appearance more consistent with a localized focal spike in the left frontal region. Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed in multiple flash frequencies and did not induce a significant photic driving response.  Of note, a photoparoxysmal response was not identified.  During the course of the recording, the heart rate varied between 70 and 90 beats. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness due to the presence of generalized bifrontal spike and wave discharges and a focal left frontal spike and wave discharge. CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  The presence of bifrontal generalized spike-wave discharges may suggest an idiopathic generalized epilepsy in this patient.  The appearance of a focal spike in the left frontal region may suggest fragmentation of the generalized pattern during drowsiness but may also suggest the concomitant appearance of a generalized process plus a localized process, such as may be seen in __________ epilepsy or possibly in generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+).  Clinical correlation is advised.'"

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Haldol, Lorazepam, Hydralazine, Dexamethasone, Insulin. REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion and change in mental status. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, but was lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact during the recording. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffusely slow recording with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is lack of normal frontal central beta seen.  The patient is only recorded in wakefulness and no activating procedures were performed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves seen at C4/F4 at times in rhythmic bursts of 2 Hz consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED'S) almost continuously throughout the recording. Focal slow waves seen at C4/F4 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-100 mV also seen continuously throughout the recording. Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously throughout the recording. SEIZURES:  During the recording at one point the rhythmic PLED'S appeared to increase in frequency and evolve to infrequency and decreasing amplitude for about 1 minute and 20 seconds.  In the video there does not appear to be a clinical correlate which is consistent with an electrographic seizure. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Right frontal central PLED'S. One electrographic seizure. Generalized slow waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals one single electrographic seizure coming from the right fronto-central region. In addition, there is evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability in the right frontal central region which is consistent with the known frontal mass.  There was also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology and may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.\""

INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed from October 20, 2012 to October 21, 2012 for 24-hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and obtundation.  The patient had no activating procedures performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  The overall background is slow with a theta frequency and at times with bursts of intermittent beta bursts seen diffusely.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed. Abnormal discharges: Focal sharp waves seen almost continuously over the left hemisphere which appeared to have an initial maximal negativity at F7 and sometimes FP1.  However, this appears to travel centrally and posteriorly over the left hemisphere towards C3 and at times P3/T5.  These sharp waves are seen at a frequency of 1 to 2 Hz and at times have rhythmic runs, but do not clearly evolve.  The periodicity is consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's). Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.  Note:  Although there is marked diffuse slowing at times, the patient is stimulated and there appears to be reactivity with muscle artifact and slight increase in frequency. Seizures:  None seen.

Continuous spike wave detection, as well as seizure detection software, in addition to patient's alarms and nurses notes were used to review the EEG. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The video was not focused on the patient for the majority of the study. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record still reveals a diffuse slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm with frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep/wake activity.  No activating procedures were performed. Overall there is diffuse delta slowing that at times has an overriding frontal maximal beta that starts and stops and appears to be related to stimulation.  The EEG does appear to reactive also with stimulation. Abnormal discharges: Focal sharp waves seen periodically at F7/T3, at times moving more centrally, but as the EEG has gone along they appear to settle more over the temporal and sometimes posterior temporal region.  It appears that the beginning phase of the sharp waves is more frontal and moves more posteriorly.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall there is a generalized delta with at times overriding bursts of theta bursts.  At times there is also slight diffuse attenuation. Abnormal discharges: 1. Focal sharp waves seen continuously with a frontal predominance at F7/F3 that appear to move more posteriorly, more centrally, and then more posteriorly towards C3 and P3 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz rhythmically and monomorphically consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's). 2.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background is attenuated and slow at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts.

      "text/plain": "' INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit.  One seizure was recorded overnight. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness and sleep, the background EEG remains poorly organized. There is rhythmic, sharply contoured delta activity, some of which demonstrates a double phase reversal in the left frontocentral region.  There is independent spike and slow wave activity including the left central region, as well as the right frontal region. SEIZURE TIME 23:52:45:  The patient is asleep and is leaning to the left.  The first clear ictal change is at 23:52:55 with a burst of generalized fast activity.  With the first burst of fast activity the patient seems to alert slightly and to shift back with her right arm.  Her left arm remains motionless.  She has initial vocalization.  The left arm is to the side and the right arm demonstrates tonic-clonic activity.  The tonic-clonic activity is much more intense in the right arm than the left initially, and the left arm is more stiff and postured.  The tonic-clonic activity partly obscures the EEG activity.  The activity begins to slow down by 23:54:05, although the motor activity becomes greater in amplitude and the frequency of the EEG is slowing.  The movements and the ictal activity again are slowing at 23:54:05 and the patient has noisy but vigorous respirations.  The EEG demonstrates a flattening, particularly from the left frontocentral region at 23:54:15.  The flattening persists at 23:54:38, at which point the EEG demonstrates a generalized attenuation and then marked background suppression with a burst of generalized higher amplitude and more difficult to localize sharp and slow wave activity at 23:54:47.  Behaviorally, as the convulsive activity ends, the patient is somnolent and the nurseâ\\x80\\x99s first cue to check on the patient is her altered respirations.  The nurse monitors the patient and by 12:12 AM, the patient is returning to her baseline mental status, although she reports feeling quite exhausted.  No additional seizures are identified in the time period that follows.  By the time the patientâ\\x80\\x99s mental status returns to baseline, the EEG has returned to the disorganized pattern previously described with high amplitude, spike and slow wave activity, which is multifocal but does include the left frontocentral region and the right frontal region, as well as more intense fast activity from the left frontotemporal region. Reviewing the seizure with a hypersensitivity filter of 20 Hz, again there appears to be a burst of generalized paroxysmal fast activity diffusely with high amplitude spike and slow wave activity 1.5 seconds later.  Precise localization is challenging and the activity seems to emanate relatively symmetrically from the frontocentral regions with a generalized pattern at onset.  The primary localizing feature is the behavior with elevation of the left arm and at the very, very onset of the seizure almost a fencer-like posture, but with more characteristic tonic-clonic activity on the right.  However, it must be noted that the patient turns to the left at the onset of the seizure and then turns back to the right later on, again, raising concerns about actual localization of the seizure.'"

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old woman status post recent cardiac stent placement with progressive encephalopathy and asterixis. Seizures this am, now intubated with right arm twitching. MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenobarbital INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The recording begins at 9 a.m. after the patient has had 8 mg Ativan. She is intubated and demonstrates intermittent rhythmic movement of the right hand only. This was a 20 minute baseline and 5 hour EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although there Is a fair amount of muscle and motion artifact in the EEG, when the muscle artifact drops out, a lower voltage pattern of a mixture of theta and delta activity can be identified. There is almost a bit of discontinuity with 2 Hz delta activity and scant amount of 6 Hz theta activity. Superimposed upon this is a periodic complex from the right hemisphere maximum in the right frontotemporal and frontocentral regions with an F2 sharp wave. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact. Some sections of the record with more muscle artifact are associated with eye movement and unfortunately in these sections of the record, it is difficult to really define the underlying EEG pattern due to the muscle artifact. As the recording continues, the epileptiform activity can be identified particularly using an average reference and it is maximum more at F8 than at FT2. Again, each time that the patient has eye movement, it is more challenging to see the EEG, but the eye movements are relatively slower. Phenobarbital is initiated at 10:54 for a total of 500 mg. This actually produces an increase in overall theta frequency in the record and more of a transition to a more of a rhythmic theta pattern. There are some sharp waves picked up in the left frontal region at 11:58. There is a subtle intermittent discontinuity noted particularly at 2 p.m. The sharp waves are improved despite some muscle artifact as the recording continues. It is not possible to determine if the patient has been twitching later on in the record. Her hand is covered up. By 3:14 when the record stops and she seems to have a little bit more muscle artifact, the sharp waves can be identified but they are not occurring in bursts. The EEG concludes at 3:18. IMPRESSION: This is a challenging but markedly abnormal EEG due to: 1. An initial clinical appearance of seizure characterized by movements of the right hand and repetitive sharp waves in the right. 2. Marked background slowing. 3. Very slow pattern seen initially with an improvement to more of a theta frequency pattern following the use of the phenobarbital. 4. Rare frontal sharp waves on the left. CLINICAL CORRELATION: Overall, by the end of this section of this EEG, there is an improvement in the overall background, which is particularly important given the significant focal features noted initially.'"

EEG (9/12/2005): Right much more than left temporal sharp waves. Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk. Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options. If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures; The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient\\'s exam there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a \"low risk\" service Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 24 hours each day the patient was monitored and attended via video by an EEG technician with special training in seizure recognition and testing. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media. DESCRIPTION OF EMU EVALUATION: Initial EEG: A routine 21-channel initial EEG was performed with the patient awake. The posterior dominant rhythm was a symmetric 1O Hz. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Photic stimulation resulted in appropriate photic driving.

He does not follow motor or verbal commands in English or Spanish. He shows some mouth movements and his eyes are deviated to the right. He then appears to arouse slightly and intermittently have body jerks .Seizure stopped on EEG at this point. Jerks have no clear spread followed by a 1second pause and restarting clearly at T4 with a 6Hz sharp wave discharge that rapidly spreads to the anterior temporal region and bi-frontally. This continues to evolve the EEG is lost for a 1minute and 30 seconds. After the EEG returns there is diffuse slowing with intermittent muscle jerk artifact.Seizure duration is unclear. EKG HR increased from 60 to 120 during the event. cannot recall code word Event #2: Date:  1211412015\\tTime:  08:51:53PM Baseline: Clinical features: While awake in bed. Suddenly starts slapping the bed with his right hand and starts trembling his legs. He then slumps to the right. He then lays there motionless. He is not tested until after the seizure stops. EEG features: While awake. Sudden right posterior quadrant 4Hz discharge that moves rapidly to the left frontoÂ\\xad temporal region and settles there before spreading bilaterally it continues to evolve in frequency and amplitude and suddenly stops. There is diffuse slowing after. Seizure duration in 1 minute and 5 seconds. EKG HR increased from 84 to 180 during the event. INDUCTION PROCEDURES: None SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS: lnterictal Findings: Frequent right anterior temporal more than posterior quadrant and occipital sharp waves. Occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves lctal Findings: The patient had 2 clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit. SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS: 1. CPS EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS: 1. Localization related epilepsy arising from the right hemisphere likely from the occipital region. CONCLUSION: admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video EEG. During the EMU monitoring session 2 events were captured with sudden sideways slumping, mouth movements and postictal agitation. The EEG pointed to a right posterior quadrant onset. Frequent right anterior temporal and occipital as well as infrequent left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in those regions. The patient\\'s carbamazepine was tapered in half over the course of her admission. He was restarted on his medications and zonisamide dose was increased on the day prior to his discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization. After this data is acquired and will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of intracranial monitoring I electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.'"

Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk. Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options. If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures; The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient\\'s exam there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a \"low risk\" service Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 24 hours each day the patient was monitored and attended via video by an EEG technician with special training in seizure recognition and testing. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media. DESCRIPTION OF EMU EVALUATION: Initial EEG: A routine 21-channel initial EEG was performed with the patient awake. The posterior dominant rhythm was a symmetric 1O Hz. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Photic stimulation resulted in appropriate photic driving.

He then stares and appears to move his mouth.He is tested and code word given (it\\'s not clear if he was still seizing as the EEG was lost). He does not follow motor or verbal commands in English or Spanish. He shows some mouth movements and his eyes are deviated to the right. He then appears to arouse slightly and intermittently have body jerks .Seizure stopped on EEG at this point. Jerks have no clear spread followed by a 1second pause and restarting clearly at T4 with a 6Hz sharp wave discharge that rapidly spreads to the anterior temporal region and bi-frontally. This continues to evolve the EEG is lost for a 1minute and 30 seconds. After the EEG returns there is diffuse slowing with intermittent muscle jerk artifact.Seizure duration is unclear. EKG HR increased from 60 to 120 during the event. cannot recall code word Event #2: Date:  1211412015\\tTime:  08:51:53PM Baseline: Clinical features: While awake in bed. Suddenly starts slapping the bed with his right hand and starts trembling his legs. He then slumps to the right. He then lays there motionless. He is not tested until after the seizure stops. EEG features: While awake. Sudden right posterior quadrant 4Hz discharge that moves rapidly to the left frontoÂ\\xad temporal region and settles there before spreading bilaterally it continues to evolve in frequency and amplitude and suddenly stops. There is diffuse slowing after. Seizure duration in 1 minute and 5 seconds. EKG HR increased from 84 to 180 during the event. INDUCTION PROCEDURES: None SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS: lnterictal Findings: Frequent right anterior temporal more than posterior quadrant and occipital sharp waves. Occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves lctal Findings: The patient had 2 clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit. SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS: 1. CPS EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS: 1. Localization related epilepsy arising from the right hemisphere likely from the occipital region. CONCLUSION: admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video EEG. During the EMU monitoring session 2 events were captured with sudden sideways slumping, mouth movements and postictal agitation. The EEG pointed to a right posterior quadrant onset. Frequent right anterior temporal and occipital as well as infrequent left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in those regions. The patient\\'s carbamazepine was tapered in half over the course of her admission. He was restarted on his medications and zonisamide dose was increased on the day prior to his discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization. After this data is acquired and will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of intracranial monitoring I electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.'"

He does not follow motor or verbal commands in English or Spanish. He shows some mouth movements and his eyes are deviated to the right. He then appears to arouse slightly and intermittently have body jerks .Seizure stopped on EEG at this point. Jerks have no clear spread followed by a 1second pause and restarting clearly at T4 with a 6Hz sharp wave discharge that rapidly spreads to the anterior temporal region and bi-frontally. This continues to evolve the EEG is lost for a 1minute and 30 seconds. After the EEG returns there is diffuse slowing with intermittent muscle jerk artifact.Seizure duration is unclear. EKG HR increased from 60 to 120 during the event. cannot recall code word Event #2: Date:  1211412015\\tTime:  08:51:53PM Baseline: Clinical features: While awake in bed. Suddenly starts slapping the bed with his right hand and starts trembling his legs. He then slumps to the right. He then lays there motionless. He is not tested until after the seizure stops. EEG features: While awake. Sudden right posterior quadrant 4Hz discharge that moves rapidly to the left frontoÂ\\xad temporal region and settles there before spreading bilaterally it continues to evolve in frequency and amplitude and suddenly stops. There is diffuse slowing after. Seizure duration in 1 minute and 5 seconds. EKG HR increased from 84 to 180 during the event. INDUCTION PROCEDURES: None SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS: lnterictal Findings: Frequent right anterior temporal more than posterior quadrant and occipital sharp waves. Occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves lctal Findings: The patient had 2 clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit. SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS: 1. CPS EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS: 1. Localization related epilepsy arising from the right hemisphere likely from the occipital region. CONCLUSION: admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video EEG. During the EMU monitoring session 2 events were captured with sudden sideways slumping, mouth movements and postictal agitation. The EEG pointed to a right posterior quadrant onset. Frequent right anterior temporal and occipital as well as infrequent left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in those regions. The patient\\'s carbamazepine was tapered in half over the course of her admission. He was restarted on his medications and zonisamide dose was increased on the day prior to his discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization. After this data is acquired and will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of intracranial monitoring I electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.'"

EEG (9/12/2005): Right much more than left temporal sharp waves. Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons: The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk. Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options. If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate. Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus; The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures; The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient\\'s exam there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a \"low risk\" service Conditions of the recording: A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail. Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 24 hours each day the patient was monitored and attended via video by an EEG technician with special training in seizure recognition and testing. A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media. DESCRIPTION OF EMU EVALUATION: Initial EEG: A routine 21-channel initial EEG was performed with the patient awake. The posterior dominant rhythm was a symmetric 1O Hz. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Photic stimulation resulted in appropriate photic driving.

There is diffuse slowing after. Seizure duration in 1 minute and 5 seconds. EKG HR increased from 84 to 180 during the event. INDUCTION PROCEDURES: None SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS: lnterictal Findings: Frequent right anterior temporal more than posterior quadrant and occipital sharp waves. Occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves lctal Findings: The patient had 2 clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit. SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS: 1. CPS EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS: 1. Localization related epilepsy arising from the right hemisphere likely from the occipital region. CONCLUSION: admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 6 days with continuous video EEG. During the EMU monitoring session 2 events were captured with sudden sideways slumping, mouth movements and postictal agitation. The EEG pointed to a right posterior quadrant onset. Frequent right anterior temporal and occipital as well as infrequent left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focus in those regions. The patient\\'s carbamazepine was tapered in half over the course of her admission. He was restarted on his medications and zonisamide dose was increased on the day prior to his discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization. After this data is acquired and will be presented at surgical conference to discuss the possibility of intracranial monitoring I electrocorticography as a next step in her surgical evaluation.'"

      "text/plain": "\" CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 48-year-old male with childhood epilepsy, complicated by AVM resection, with recurrent and refractory seizures experienced by the patient as right arm jerking.  Patient feels that he is aware during his seizures. MEDICATIONS:  Aptiom, Keppra, and Depakote. INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection software. October 20-21, 2014 During the 1st 24 hours of recording, medications were not reduced. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  A subtle breach rhythm is noted from the right temporal region.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  in sleep, there is some subtle features including an amplitude asymmetry with somewhat higher amplitude activity on the right compared to the left, but without clear left temporal focal slowing.  Intermittent focal slowing is noted in the right posterior temporal region. Clinical seizures:  None. Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  This section of the record identifies primarily brief or isolated spike and wave complexes.  These are variable in nature and are typically brief, 4-5 Hz spike and wave complexes.  They appear to be somewhat distorted by the breach rhythm.  The vast majority of them have a phase reversal at the midline.  Additional discharges include some alpha or beta frequency activity in the right hemisphere, which typically seen in drowsiness without a clear spike and wave component, but with a little bit of after going slowing.  One example of this is at 1:53:13 a.m. on the morning of the 21st.  Many of the epileptiform discharges occur in stage 2 sleep.  Some of them seem to be superimposed on sleep morphology, essentially maximum at the vertex with some asymmetry in terms of a field.  There was also a single left temporal sharp wave noted. IMPRESSION:  This 1st 24 hours of EEG monitoring was remarkable for: Interictal epileptiform discharges, which were primarily generalized spike and wave complexes with a very unusual field and morphology. Intermittent focal slowing and a breach rhythm in the right posterior quadrant. Rare, more isolated higher amplitude theta in the right posterior quadrant. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were recorded.  Additional EEG monitoring will continue in search of the patient's typical seizures. October 21-22, 2014 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   BACKGROUND: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with generous background beta.  Sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  The patient's breach rhythm is more prominent in the posterior region. Seizures:  None. Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  This section of the record captures occasional spike and wave complexes, although few were typed in the sample file.  The seemed to be the 3-4 hertz generalized, but somewhat irregular discharges. Heart rate 60 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This section of EEG monitoring was remarkable for: No seizures. Interictal spike and wave complexes. A breach rhythm with occasional focal slowing. October 22-23, 2014 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall waking background is low voltage.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs. Electrographic Seizures:  The 1st event for this individual occurs at 5:28:00.  The patient is eating.  He is noted to have an increase in heart rate from 90 beats per minute to 114 beats per minute with some irregularity.  He is eating and his right hand is underneath the tray, but the elbow jerks and the lid to the tray falls.  He pushes the button and reports to the nurse that he had a seizure.  The EEG is obscured by muscle and chew artifact, and no epileptiform activity was identified. In the 1.5 hours that follow, the patient was noted to have somewhat sustained tachycardia with heart rate approximately 120 bpm, slightly irregular heart rate, and occasional PVCs, occasional isolated approximately 4 Hz spike and wave discharges were noted, some of which have a bifid component in the right posterior quadrant. A cluster of 50 seizures was identified beginning at 8:05.  Most seizures were 4-8 seconds in duration.  Seizures were characterized by a burst of 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity, which was somewhat irregular.  Using various montages, the activity is maximum at the midline,Cz though a few discharges maximum in the right or left central region were noted. Behavioral characteristics of these seizures included no clinical signs in the 1st second or the first 2-3 discharges.  The 2nd finding was jerking of the right arm.  If the patient was speaking, he would speak in the 1st second, but speech arrest was noted during the 3rd through 5th second of the discharge.  He seemed to be aware of all events and did not appear to lose his train of thought during seizures.  Clinical staff was present through the vast majority of these seizures. Tonic-Clonic Seizure:  Time, 8:29:30, duration 1 minute 1.15 seconds.  This was a tonic-clonic seizure.  It began with a burst of spike and wave activity, maximum at the midline with 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.  By 8:29:04, polyspike or fast activity was noted with rhythmic theta and then the EEG was obscured by tonic motor activity. Behavior:   After 1 second, the patient had right arm trembling.  At 8:29:03 as the fast activity increases, the right arm comes up and then the left arm comes up a second later.  Both arms were elevated in a salaam like posture.  At  8:29:08, the patient's mouth opens and then clonic activity is noted at 8:29:15.  Tonic-clonic activity is noted at the end and the postictal EEG is diffusely slow with prominent delta at the midline.  The physician and nurse are at the bedside.  Ativan was given Prolonged postictal delta was noted with the appearance of beta by 8:42.  By midnight, the patient seems to have transitioned to stage 2 sleep with beta spindles.  The remaining sections of the overnight recording demonstrates, little in the way of interictal epileptiform activity. Interictal epileptiform activity:  As noted previously, 3.5-4 Hz spike and wave activity often occurring in stage 2 sleep on the context of a vertex wave. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal 24-hour EEG monitoring due to: Cluster of seizures, which all began with right arm jerking, although there is a generalized EEG signature.  Speech arrest was a later finding in the brief seizures and the patient did appear to be aware during the seizures. Tonic-clonic seizure with same initial features. INTERVAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This section of the EEG was diagnostic with generalized epilepsy and consideration for a secondary generalized mechanism is appropriate. October 23-24, 2014 MEDICATIONS:  Eslicarbazepine, Keppra.  Depakote on hold. INTRODUCTION:  This 24-hour video EEG monitoring, was performed after a cluster of seizures the night before with the use of benzodiazepines. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Abundant stage 2 sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Early slow wave sleep was noted.  Subtle underlying focal slowing in the breach rhythm were noted in the right posterior quadrant. Electrographic seizures:  None. Epileptiform Detections:  There are some brief bursts of spike and wave activity, typically less than 2 seconds in duration.  The patient was not aware of symptoms during these brief bursts.  Epileptiform activity can be reviewed in multiple different montages and includes a 3 to 4.5 Hz spike and wave complex, which is somewhat irregular in nature.  Using an average reference, some waveforms are maximum either at CZ or FP1.  There are also some irregular bursts.  Rare bursts of more paroxysmal theta with an amplitude accentuation in the right posterior quadrant were noted in sleep.  In addition, there were a handful of lower voltage discreet sharp waves in the right posterior quadrant. Heart rate 78, BPM without PVCs or other cardiac anomalies today. IMPRESSION:  This is a final day of continuous video EEG monitoring.  The overall session was remarkable for: Electrographic seizures, which began with a subtle seizure without clear scalp EEG correlate.  All seizures began with jerking of the right with arm, approximately 1 second after the spike and wave discharge followed by speech arrest and then little in the way of postictal period with the exception of the tonic-clonic seizure.  The discharges noted were generalized in morphology with a CZ localization, but without a definite scalp localization. Tonic-clonic seizure, which began with a similar electrographic and behavioral characteristics with tonic and clonic activity as well as prolonged postictal slowing. Interictal epileptiform detections, which include an irregular 3-4 Hz spike and wave complex.  Some of these are maximum at the midline, but using alternative techniques some can be demonstrated to be left frontal and less so right frontal. Marked tachycardia and frequent PVCs noted on the day of the seizures, eat well before the first seizure occurs. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a generalized epilepsy, which is likely a secondarily generalized epilepsy.  All  seizures were stereotypic in initial characteristics\""

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Neurontin, Serentil, and Topamax. INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has multiple episodes of head rocking during the recording and then removes her electrodes. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: During this 24 hour section, there were two drop events reported: one at approximately 3:00 PM and the other at 8:00 AM.  Reviewing the extensive files, these behaviors cannot be easily identified. The waking background remains abnormal.  Following the administration of Ativan on the 15th, there is an increase in somnolence followed by an alerting response with a suggestion of an alpha rhythm and a background with theta.  In this portion of the record, the drop attacks decreased dramatically, with only two clinical drop attacks reported.  Despite this, there are frequent bursts of frontally predominant high amplitude poly spike and slow wave activity with bursts lasting 3 to 7 and even 10 seconds in duration. In addition to the generalized, frontally predominant bursts, there are also focal bursts of spike and slow wave activity some of which demonstrate an occipital predominant left or right.  These bursts are not as sustained as those from the frontal region.  There are portions of the record when the patient is drowsy where there is a suggestion of temporal wicket.  The overnight recording captured sleep with an alpha and theta pattern and slower, higher amplitude spike and slow wave activity, but without all of the typical wave forms of sleep. HR:  78 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Slow spike and wave activity with poly spike and slow wave activity and generalized spike and slow activity ranging from 1.6 Hz to 5 Hz. Occipitally predominant spike and slow wave activity. Generalized background slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient had clinical atonic seizures associated with these discharges in the initial portion of the record, but not in later portions of the record. This may be due to administration of benzodiazepines, Topiramate, or cessation of Zyprexa.'"

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Phenobarb INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient appears ill, has her face wrapped in a gauze and is poorly responsive. This record includes 120 minutes baseline and 4 hours of EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal background with rhythmic theta and delta. There is frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity, but there is also a very prominent focus of right frontal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave activity. This is a high amplitude discharge. In addition, there are a handful of left anterior temporal sharp waves observed as well. There is no indication in the EEG provided that the patient received therapy and the overall duration of the piece of EEG provided is 4 hours and 20 minutes.

The seizures seem to have stopped by 12:33. Intermittent sharp waves are noted in the section of the record that follows, but they appear to be ebbing. The overall pattern transitions to a much lower, slower voltage pattern with a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta, as well as occasional bursts of right FT sharp waves.

A pattern of increasing slowing over the course of the record provided of unclear nature. 4. Right Fronto temporal sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION: Little information is provided, but Ativan was given during the EEG particularly at 12:20 and 12:24 and 12:27 and again 12:36. This was effective with the third dose of Ativan clearly having an impact and resolution of the status epilepticus by 12:41.

Prior history epilepsy and PCP use. MEDICATIONS:  DM meds, Amoxicillin, AS, norvasc, Tylenol #3 INTRODUCTION:  Emergent, digital video EEG was performed in the emergency room using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively drowsy.  This is a somewhat technically challenging EEG with impedances greater than 5 kilohms. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG is markedly slow with primarily a delta theta pattern.  Over time, the patient is increasingly awake with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm. As the patient becomes awake and alert, she subsequently has a focal seizure out of the left hemisphere with repetitive 6-8 hertz theta frequency activity.  This seizure begins at 1:59 PM and was characterized by facial grimacing and a small amount of head turning from side to side.  When asked to for her name, she is unable to respond.  The seizure ends very slowly with a very prolonged postictal transition.  Total seizure duration 2 minutes 17 seconds.  By 2:01:18, the seizure is clearly abating. Post ictal record demonstrates a pattern similar to the beginning of the record with a slow and disorganized pattern with generous delta and bursts of frontal delta. A 2nd seizure is noted as the patient starts recover from the first seizure at 2:18:05.  The technologist realizes immediately that the patient is confused, asks the patient her name and she is not able to respond.  The patient has oral automatisms and looks to be either side.  She has eye deviation to left The technologist notes that the patient is able to squeeze fingers by 2:19:55.  The patient does not recall a code word.  Total seizure duration approximately 2 minutes 39 seconds. This ictal pattern includes repetitive rhythmic initially theta frequency activity, maximum in the left frontal/frontotemporal region with clear frequency evolution.  There is a generous field of spread in the left hemisphere, particularly frontal temporal.  Though the activity is most prominent in the anterior temporal region, within seconds the activity is really throughout the left hemisphere. The recording concludes at 2:23.  No additional seizures were noted. IMPRESSION:  This 40-minute EEG was remarkable for: 1. Two seizures from the left hemisphere, maximum in the frontal regions with a strong representation in the temporal region. 2. A background slowing and disorganization, which improved overtime, until the patient seized again. 3. Epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere including frontal and temporal. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this clinical context, with multiple seizures today in a patient who has not entirely returned to background mental status, this EEG is compatible with a complex partial status epilepticus pattern.  This patient will go onto continuous video EEG monitoring.'"

MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol with Codeine, Asthma medications as needed. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage 2 sleep. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm is 9.5-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is presence of low-amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as presence of posts vertex sharp transients, K complexes, and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation was performed and results in diffuse slowing of the background activity intermixed with high amplitude 3 Hz delta activity lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed and resulted in a driving response with no abnormal response.  The patient had 2 episodes of body jerks while awake during the recording without any ictal change on EEG.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular. IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  Intermittent body jerks were captured during the recording without any ictal change on EEG.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Intermittent body jerks without any ictal change on EEG suggestive of these being probably subcortical in origin.  No epileptiform abnormalities were seen in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.'"

Medications:\\tno AEDs Sedation: EEG Type:\\tExtended, 40-60 min Technique:\\tInternational 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric A single ~ 36 second focal seizure is captured.  Clinically, it starts with patient having slight difficulty staying a year and bringing both hand to his face.  Then lips smacking and chewing movements are observed.  He remains alert.  He is able to state  correctly the location, his name and count to 10.  Additionally, patient's heart rate increases from the resting ~100 bpm to ~130 bpm during the seizure.  There is ~ 10-11 second delay between clinical symptoms and EEG change.  Electrographically, ~5 Hz moderate-to-high amplitude rhythmic bilateral anterior theta activity is noted.  This activity increases in amplitude and decreases in frequency.  This change is more profound over the right.  Post-ictally, there is right anterior polymorphic delta and mild attenuation.  As patient falls asleep, 8-second run of rhythmic ~ 0.5 Hz LEFT anterior temporal Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities. Summary of Findings: Seizure, one, bilateral anterior, ~36 seconds, pt able to count, increase in HR Sharp waves, left temporal, anterior, brief run at 0.5 Hz Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 40 minute EEG due to a single focal seizure and several left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges.

IMPRESSION:  The 1st 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for burst of rhythmic slowing, noted only in the initial hours of recording on the day of admission. 08/20/2014 to 08/21/2014 The 24-hour section of EEG monitoring for this patient was recorded in 2 sections. Background: Random wakefulness and sleep and wakefulness, the background EEG was well organized.  In wakefulness, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic background slowing noted.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles. Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted. Seizure: 12:47 AM.  The patient had been in bed sleeping, though she was awake at the time of the seizure.  The patient's perception was that she was asleep; she did not recall the seizure.  She was under the covers and no clinical features were noted.  Electrographically, this 2-minute seizure was characterized by rhythmic theta from the left temporal region with transition by 12:47:13 to repetitive sharp waves and spikes of fast activity as well.  This seizure begins to slow by 12:48:16 with a periodic complex, which gradually fades with slow delta.  This seizure ends at 12:49:30, with postictal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity 2:37:55.  This 1 minute 29 second electrographic seizure begins again during the overnight hours and the patient was asleep.  This event begins with rhythmic mixed theta, delta from the left hemisphere maximum at T1 with a generous field of spread into the anterior temporal region.

This seizure ends at 12:49:30, with postictal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity 2:37:55.  This 1 minute 29 second electrographic seizure begins again during the overnight hours and the patient was asleep.  This event begins with rhythmic mixed theta, delta from the left hemisphere maximum at T1 with a generous field of spread into the anterior temporal region.  It transitions to repetitive sharp activity at 12:38:06 and then a polyspike component and then a slow periodic complex.  This seizure ends at 12:39:25 with focal slowing noted from the left hemisphere and disruption of faster frequency activity. Heart rate 60 BPM. Interval Impression/Clinical Correlation:  The 1st 48 hours of EEG monitoring was remarkable for. Intermittent bursts of rhythmic slowing. Two electrographic seizures from the left temporal region both occurring out of sleep.  The seizures are as the patient describes, occurring without her awareness of the event.  In addition, because they occur out of sleep, there are few clinical manifestations noted. DATE OF STUDY:  August 21 through August 22nd. CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old woman with adult onset refractory epilepsy. MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Effexor, y others. INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  No seizures were reported by the patient, clinical team or the computer. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted in sleep. Interictal discharges:  Intermittent bursts of theta were noted with more of a frontal predominance.  Some of these seem to have almost a left frontotemporal notch theta, approximately 4Hz. No other well-defined sharp waves or spikes were noted in this section of the record. Pushbuttons:  Practice pushbuttons were performed at 7:59, 9:23 a.m., 6:42 p.m., and 8:54 p.m.  No seizures had occurred at that time. Seizures:  None. Heart rate 60 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This is the third day of continuous video EEG monitoring.  Overall, the long-term monitoring session is remarkable for: Two electrographic seizures with left temporal lobe maximum, occurring out of sleep. Intermittent bursts of rhythmic slowing. Intermittent bursts of notched slowing with a frontal maximum, perhaps more so on the left. A paucity of interictal  focal epileptiform complexes. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with an unusual family history of epilepsy, this EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  As the patient disclosed in her history, she has almost exclusively nocturnal seizures.  The seizures that were recorded were in the overnight hours with the patient under the covers, therefore behavioral manifestations of the seizures were not well described.\""

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is progressively unresponsive. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During much of the recording, the patient is poorly responsive.  The background ranges from low voltage with a mixture of delta and theta to intermittent left temporal sharp waves. There are intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta from the left.  There are also occasional, frontally predominant triphasic waves. The patient has multiple practice push buttons, which are not associated with a change in the EEG.

There is also almost complete attenuation of left hemisphere which supports cortical dysfunction in that region.  Lastly there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.

Sedation: EEG Type:\\tExtended, >60 min, portable Technique:\\tInternational 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose Description: There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with voltage attenuation and slower waveforms over the right.  The background over the left consists of 8-9 Hz activity posteriorly, with expected but weak AP gradient and diffuse excess theta activity.  The background over the right consists of a mixture of attenuated theta and delta activity.  Frequent episodes of arousals are noted.  Many of them start with a coughing fit or in response to a noise in the room or patient stimulation (such as suctioning).  Electrographically they are characterized by appearance of diffuse, left anterior predominant rhythmic delta activity and increase in voltages and prominence of activity seen in the left posterior quadrant.  Continuous EKG artifact is present.  Occasional sleep-spindle-like waveforms are present.  Additionally, episodes of arousals and quiescence are captured. A single suspected seizure is captured at ~11:14 AM.  It lasts ~ 4.5 minutes.  It starts gradually with appearance of left anterior rhythmic sharply contoured ~ 1.5 Hz delta activity and increase in amplitude of activity within the left posterior  quadrant.  This activity persists with appearance of diffuse fast activities.  Blinking artifact appears at ~ 11:16:11 am and lasts till ~ 11:17:27 am.  Blink artifact is not rhythmic.  Clinically, patient appears to move her head slightly in the flexion/extension motion.  Episode of rapid left hand shaking is captured from ~12:58:11 PM till ~ 12:58:47 pm.

A single SUSPECTED seizure emanating from the left (possibly left anterior region).  That episode could also have been a prolonged more profound arousal since activity that was seen within a seizure resembles activity seen during patient's arousals.  ~ 30 second episode of LEFT arm shaking had no abnormal EEG correlate.

Patient had a breakthrough tonic-clonic seizure 1 week ago with postictal confusion.  Seizure preceded by an episode of lightheadedness. INTRODUCTION:  A 22-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The awake EEG is remarkable for a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm with generous frontal central beta and a small amount of theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is prominent frontal theta noted in the record already rich in theta.  Some of this is notched particularly in the left frontal region. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained. Hyperventilation was performed with good effort, producing an increase in theta again with a somewhat focal response with frontally predominant notched theta from the left.  Some of this was present bilaterally, but again with asymmetry.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.  Immediately after hyperventilation, the patient transitioned briefly into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Sleep however was brief in this record. Heart rate:  50-60 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to: Prominent excess beta. Prominent excess theta. Paroxysmal bursts of theta with a questionable underlying left frontal sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.  Given the generous beta and theta, careful review of this patient's medication history is important to make sure that there are no other underlying medications that might contribute to this pattern.  There is suspicious underlying paroxysmal theta with sharp wave.  A more prolonged study may be helpful to characterize a potential underlying epileptic focus.\""

The patient is described increasingly responsive during this overnight recording. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background starts out at a markedly abnormal background with a mixture of theta and delta. The pattern includes some frontally predominant triphasic waves which improve over time and bilateral generalized periodic epileptiform discharges. Focal sharp waves are seen in the left posterior temporal region at T3 and T5, but those are improving to some extent during the course of the record.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was intubated and unresponsive. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrated low voltage and diffuse slowing.  It is poorly organized, intermixed with frequent spike and slow waves. Frequently, bursts of spike and slow waves lasted for 30 to 90 seconds without change in the background.  This electrical epileptiform discharge activity was correlated with the physical epilepsy activity on video.  As the recording continues in the situation of no information about a Propofol drip, it is not easy to identify the physical seizures when we subsequently frequently identify the signal spike and slow wave bursts.  Within the 24-hour time frame, from 12:00 noon to 12:00 midnight, more than 50 spells of the bursts of spike and slow wave activity lasting 30 to 90 seconds were identified.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In this 24 hour section of the record, the record includes wakefulness in sleep. There are some sections where the activity is reasonably well organized on the right with an 8 hertz alpha rhythm. In other sections, the activity is slow bilaterally and there is slight attenuation. Frequent high amplitude poly spike activity is identified from the left hemisphere with a generous field of spread, but it is most prominent in the left frontal and frontotemporal region. There is some frequency evolution to the epileptiform activity and it may occur in bursts. It never completely disappears. There are sections where there are clear bursts. but it is difficult for the clinical team to determine if this is associated with a change in the patient's function.

LONG TERM MONITORING 11/21 + 22/2010 - 10-134 INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is frequently agitated. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. Some sections of the record demonstrate more significant sharp waves and polyspike activity in the right anterior temporal region than others. In contrast to the first 24 hours of EEG recording, the sharp activity is not as periodic. It does have more of a polyphasic component. It remains high amplitude. In this section of the record, the right hemisphere is slower than it was during some sections of this study performed on 11/20/2010 through 11/21/2010. Over the course of the data provided, the EEG electrodes are sometimes lost but overall although the overall background is transitioning more to a theta pattern and there are sharp waves, there is less of the sharp waves that are building up and evolving. There is no mention as to medications that were administered at 11 a.m. on 11/22/2010, but the overall background is consistently slower. HR: 78 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING 11/23 + 24/2010 - 10-134 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much more of this record demonstrates an alpha and theta frequency pattern. The patient is also a bit more active and is sometimes able to speak. Throughout much of the record there is less in the way of epileptiform activity than previously noted. There is one section of the record at 3:50 and another at 4:04. Because of the artifacts involved it is difficult to determine if there is in fact an epileptiform seizure at that time. Review of the video is quite challenging in terms of the amount of artifact. No clinical signs or symptoms are noted and in fact with the discharge at 3:50 p.m., the patient seemed to be well. HR: 90 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING 11/25 + 27/2010 - 10-134 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record demonstrates improving pattern with primarily a theta frequency background rich in beta and alpha frequency activity. Frequent focal sharp waves and spikes are observed but they are no longer continuous and they do not evolve. Despite this, there are discrete seizures characterized by rhythmic repetitive sharp wave discharges including at 7:05p.m. There is little in the way of a clinical correlate. At 5:53a.m., frequent spiking is noted from the left anterior temporal region while the patient is sleeping. By 11:40 a.m., when the patient awakens the next morning, the epileptiform activity is improving although electrode integrity is declining. From 11/24/2010 to 11/25/2010, during this section of the record, there is no clinical information provided. The initial sections of the record on the afternoon of 11/24/2010, were reviewed by the physician and indicated complex partial seizure at 3:50 p.m. The sleep record including 12:44 demonstrates frequent spiking from the left anterior temporal region.   At 6:30 in the morning the patient is actually attempting to speak and then at 6:39, a complex partial seizure occurs. She is not speaking during the seizure. There is no testing performed during the seizure. Over the course of this section of the data 11/24/2010 to 11/25/2010, particularly during the daytime hours when the patient is awake, the background continues to improve when the patient's ability to speak is improving and overall there is a pattern of improved EEG and then a pattern with occasional sharp waves or clinical seizures. On 11/26/2010 to 11/27/2010: Due to the electrode integrity, no interpretations should be made from this section of the data. Although it is clear that there is theta frequency activity in the background, in terms of the possibility of missed seizures, this should not be considered billable data. IMPRESSION: 1. This section of continuous EEG monitoring is remarkable for an improvement in terms of the epileptiform activity on the left, although there remains a polyspike focus in the left centrotemporal region. 2. An increase in background slowing.\""

There are sections where there are clear bursts. but it is difficult for the clinical team to determine if this is associated with a change in the patient's function. Some of the epileptiform activity has bilateral representation in the frontal region. LONG TERM MONITORING 11/21 + 22/2010 - 10-134 INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is frequently agitated. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. Some sections of the record demonstrate more significant sharp waves and polyspike activity in the right anterior temporal region than others. In contrast to the first 24 hours of EEG recording, the sharp activity is not as periodic. It does have more of a polyphasic component. It remains high amplitude. In this section of the record, the right hemisphere is slower than it was during some sections of this study performed on 11/20/2010 through 11/21/2010. Over the course of the data provided, the EEG electrodes are sometimes lost but overall although the overall background is transitioning more to a theta pattern and there are sharp waves, there is less of the sharp waves that are building up and evolving. There is no mention as to medications that were administered at 11 a.m. on 11/22/2010, but the overall background is consistently slower. HR: 78 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING 11/23 + 24/2010 - 10-134 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much more of this record demonstrates an alpha and theta frequency pattern. The patient is also a bit more active and is sometimes able to speak. Throughout much of the record there is less in the way of epileptiform activity than previously noted. There is one section of the record at 3:50 and another at 4:04. Because of the artifacts involved it is difficult to determine if there is in fact an epileptiform seizure at that time. Review of the video is quite challenging in terms of the amount of artifact. No clinical signs or symptoms are noted and in fact with the discharge at 3:50 p.m., the patient seemed to be well. HR: 90 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING 11/25 + 27/2010 - 10-134 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record demonstrates improving pattern with primarily a theta frequency background rich in beta and alpha frequency activity. Frequent focal sharp waves and spikes are observed but they are no longer continuous and they do not evolve. Despite this, there are discrete seizures characterized by rhythmic repetitive sharp wave discharges including at 7:05p.m. There is little in the way of a clinical correlate. At 5:53a.m., frequent spiking is noted from the left anterior temporal region while the patient is sleeping. By 11:40 a.m., when the patient awakens the next morning, the epileptiform activity is improving although electrode integrity is declining. From 11/24/2010 to 11/25/2010, during this section of the record, there is no clinical information provided. The initial sections of the record on the afternoon of 11/24/2010, were reviewed by the physician and indicated complex partial seizure at 3:50 p.m. The sleep record including 12:44 demonstrates frequent spiking from the left anterior temporal region.   At 6:30 in the morning the patient is actually attempting to speak and then at 6:39, a complex partial seizure occurs. She is not speaking during the seizure. There is no testing performed during the seizure. Over the course of this section of the data 11/24/2010 to 11/25/2010, particularly during the daytime hours when the patient is awake, the background continues to improve when the patient's ability to speak is improving and overall there is a pattern of improved EEG and then a pattern with occasional sharp waves or clinical seizures. On 11/26/2010 to 11/27/2010: Due to the electrode integrity, no interpretations should be made from this section of the data. Although it is clear that there is theta frequency activity in the background, in terms of the possibility of missed seizures, this should not be considered billable data. IMPRESSION: 1. This section of continuous EEG monitoring is remarkable for an improvement in terms of the epileptiform activity on the left, although there remains a polyspike focus in the left centrotemporal region. 2. An increase in background slowing.\""

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a routine, 20-minute EEG with most impedances under 5 kilohms.  This record captures wakefulness and sleep. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and seems to accentuate rhythmic, left temporal slowing.  As the patient becomes slightly drowsy, the focal slowing is again somewhat more prominent in the left mid and central temporal regions.  This is overall a subtle finding. Photic stimulation was performed at the end of the record and did elicit a driving response.  At that point, the patient disclosed and she had been assaulted, and the photic stimulation was bothering an ocular injury. At the close of the record, the patient starts to transition into stage 1 sleep, but stage 1 sleep was not sustained. Heart rate 60 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to focal slowing from the left mid to anterior temporal region.  At times, more rhythmic and sustained following hyperventilation as the patient became drowsy. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous studies, this patient has previously demonstrated intermittent slowing from the left temporal region as well as discrete left frontotemporal sharp waves, although no sharp waves were noted today.'"

No clinical seizures were noted on the tracing. Continuous seizure and spike detection software were utilized. This was a technically satisfactory study. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The interictal EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern, compatible with pharmacologic coma. The overall background is medium amplitude with mixed beta, theta, and alpha frequency activity. Intermittent bursts of higher amplitude alpha frequency activity were identified. In the initial sections of the record. these seem to be artifactual with a somewhat unusual field of spread, a little bit mare left frontal and then spread to right posterior. As the recording continues. these bursts of 10 Hz frequency of activity start to stow to 9Hz. In addition, on some occasions there seems to be a right frontal sharp wave. Utilizing different techniques, the activity Is clearly highest amplitude in the left anterior temporal region. but there seems to be an underlying 8 Hz notched, almost a spike and wave. discharge In the right hemisphere, which is picked up In the right posterior temporal region. In addition, at 2:00a.m .. the activity is longer In duration with a little bit of muscle artifact. Interictal discharges: 1. Likely interictal discharges for this individual include the bursts of paroxysmal alpha frequency activity with unusual localization and unusual fields. 2. Likely frontal sharp waves. right or left maximum. Seizures: Three electrographic seizures were noted on the morning of October 2, including 4:49 a.m.5:27 a.m. and 5:59a.m. Seizure duration is approximately 1 minute. typically just under 60 seconds. The patient seems to be obtunded during the electrographic seizures, no clinical features could be noted on the video. Seizures were characterized by the appearance of repetitive 3 to 4 Hz activity, maximum in the left temporal region with frequency evolution. The epileptiform activity seems to march on despite the bursts of 10Hz frontal fast activity on the right. By 18 seconds Into the seizure, there Is some bilateral activity. Of note, the third seizure at 5:59 is a bit longer. The system uploads at 6:0916:39, and there is a seizure noted at 6:38 just as the EEG Is paused. This fourth seizure occurs with physician at bedside. It is difficult to determine if there is a clinical change in the patients behavior and/or If the patient was stimulated during the seizure because of the fact that the physicians are standing In front of the patient Each seizure ends with rhythmic repetitive slowing and then background suppression and briefly, particularly after the first seizure. there is prominent beta activity. In addition, some of the bursts of alpha frequency activity when reviewed at a slower paper speed, clearly have an attenuation. IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour video EEG monitoring is remarkable for: 1.\\tAn unusual interictal epileptiform discharge with prominent alpha frequency activity with some variability.   Particularly in later portions of the record. the overall background can be seen to attenuate, suggesting that these bursts of alpha frequency activity are clearly an interictal epileptiform signature. 2. \\tFrontal sharp waves or spikes, which are relatively are . 3.\\tElectrographic seizures from the left temporal region which can occur and march through the bursts of fast frontal activity and localize to the left temporal region.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient had 1 seizure during the first 24 hour section. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex wave K complexes, spindles and posts.  Just prior to the seizure, the patient was awake and lambda waves were identified. Seizure time was 9:09:26.  The patient is awake with nurse.  She is communicative and conversant.  This seizure began with frontally predominant 4 to 5 Hz spike in wave discharge and then a pause and then additional spike in wave activity.  The EEG is rapidly obscured by muscle and motion artifact due to the tonic clonic activity.  In the initial 30 seconds of seizure, much of the activity transitions very quickly from clonic to prolonged tonic and then tonic clonic activity starts to emerge at 9:10:12.  This seizure is ending at 09:10:26 and then the patient is poorly responsive without additional motor activity although there is a burst of high amplitude poly spike activity noted.  That activity is relatively symmetric.  The post ictal EEG is markedly slow and suppressed.  A slow, delta pattern was noted with eye movement artifacts but without definitive spikes.  Later on, the patient transitions to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  On occasion in stage 2 sleep, dyshormia is noted with a generalized spike in wave discharge in association with a vertex wave.  Abundant stage 2 sleep is captured all the way through to the morning recording. On the morning of March 5, the patient reports feeling very fatigued and sedated.  As the recording continues on the morning of the 5th, there is initially some slowing of the background but then much more awake pattern noted by 10:28 a.m. IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring in the first 24 hours for this patient identified a single generalized seizure and rare epileptiform activity.'"

Nursing- initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist. # Push button events Description of pushbutton events Description: The awake background consists of moderate amplitude 9.5-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.

She also has a diagnosis of epilepsy and her last seizure was in March of 2011.  The purpose of this EEG was to be a follow up EEG and has had recent increasing seizures to 10 to 15 seizures a day.  The patient was seen at an outside hospital on March 4, 2013. MEDICATIONS:  Olanzapine, zonisamide, ziprasidone and Bactrim. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record opens there is diffuse bihemispheric slowing in the 6-7 Hz theta range.  There is a fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm that at times attains 8-9 Hz, but at other times is disrupted by intervening theta activity.  There is excessive muscle artifact throughout the recording.  Brief stage 1 sleep is identified in which there is further slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm, decrease in behavior and movement activity and a decrease in eye blinks.  On several epochs throughout the recording there are brief 2 second bursts of what appear to be slow spike wave activity.  These are maximal over the central regions bilaterally.  In addition, there are intermittent sharp waves noted over the left frontal region and rarely over the left central region.  There were no electrographic or clinical seizures identified during the recording epoch.  Activation procedures were not performed. Heart rate varied from 60-80. IMPRESSION:  In summary, this is an abnormal EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness due to the appearance of bihemispheric slowing, as well as intermittent brief bursts of generalized low spike wave activity and rare sharp waves in the frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.  The presence of diffuse slowing and bursts of slow spike wave activity may be seen in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome as well as in secondary generalized epilepsy syndromes.  The presence of focal sharp waves in the left frontal and frontocentral region may suggest a structural brain lesion in this region that has epileptiform potential.'"

INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional single EEG lead, medical staff notes, and nursing staff notes were reviewed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Fragmented unstable 8-9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is captured bilaterally.  There is no clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Additional polymorphic theta and delta are captured.  Delta is more pronounced anteriorly.  Additionally there is paucity faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, especially anteriorly.  Voltage attenuation is present over the right mid temporal region.  Sleep architecture consisting of sleep spindle-like wave forms that are more pronounced over the left hemisphere is captured.  K-complexes are captured as well. Throughout the recording, especially with stimulation, rhythmic and semi-rhythmic 2.5 to 3 Hz polymorphic delta activity is observed over the right hemisphere, predominantly over the right anterior region. On several occasions 30-60 second events consist of delta activity with underriding low amplitude rhythmic 1 to 2 Hz low amplitude sharp waves.  There is no clear evolution of these discharges.

He has rhythmic high frequency mouth twitching that lasts approximately 2 minutes and persists even throughout the patient's coughing episodes. Electrographically there is a frontally predominant EMG artifact that is more pronounced over the left hemispheric leads. This episode likely represents a seizure.

MEDICATIONS:  Current medications Tegretol extended release 600 mg twice a day, Abilify and others. INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed utilizing the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The recording was reviewed at least once during the 24-hour period by the attending neurologist.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Nursing staff notes and medical staff notes were reviewed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 9-10 Hz alpha activity that accentuates with eyes opening.  There is anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical sleep spindles systems in the vertex phase are noted.  Continuous polymorphic theta activity sharply contoured is noted over the right temporal region.  Additional rounds of somewhat monomorphic theta activity is noted in the bifrontal EEG leads.  Independent bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves with after going slow waves are observed.  They occur much more frequently over the right.  Phase reversal occurs over the F8/T2 and F7/T1 electrodes. A single electrographic seizure is captured.  It occurs out of stage 2 sleep.  It is characterized by sudden diffuse voltage attenuation and appearance of fast activity especially in frontal leads.  After 6 seconds rhythmic delta activity is noted over the right anterior temporal region.  Similar activity is seen observed over the anterior left temporal region.  This rhythmic activity lasts approximately 20 seconds followed afterwards by diffuse delta activity that is prolonged.  Total duration of seizure appears to be approximately 2-1/2 minutes.  Clinically, the patient appears to wake up and have worsening of dystonic posturing of his right upper extremity as well as what appears to be head deviation possibly toward the right.  The video quality is not very clear.  The patient stays still until nearly the end of the seizure.  The seizure starts at 7:44:48 p.m.  The video EEG does not demonstrate patient pushing either event button or nursing call button.  Upon questioning the patient about the seizure the next day, the patient reported that he had a seizure on 08/06/2013 although he could not elaborate more about the timing of his seizure or what occurred during seizure. FINDINGS: Continuous mild-to-moderate right anterior temporal slowing to occasional independent bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves with after going slow waves, right greater than left, with phase reversal over after F8/T2 and F7/T1 electrodes. A single electrographic seizure of unclear lateralization or localization is captured. Seizure duration is approximately 2-1/2 minutes.

      "text/plain": "\" CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult female with advanced dementia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, status post aspiration, found comatose in the early morning hours of the 4th, initially comatose lacking in brainstem signs now with repetitive eye blink. MEDICATIONS:  Depakote and Versed.  Many others. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. October 6-7 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing began, there was a great deal of muscle artifact in the EEG.  In addition to the eye blink artifact, there is a periodic complex identified in the frontocentral regions with a broad field of spread in the parasagittal regions.  When reviewed with an a CZ reference, CZ appears to be active.  There are frontal, periodic, discrete sharp waves or spikes noted. Throughout the recording, a Versed drip is initiated.  The Versed drip is initiated at 11:29.  At 11:48, the patient receives 4 mg bolus of Versed which significantly decreased both periodic complexes and the background artifact.  When the sensitivity is increased, the sharp wave can be much more easily defined and is a CZ vertex sharp.  The periodicity of the sharp wave is approximately 1 per second and varies from 0.5 per second to 1 per second.  There is no frequency evolution associated with this discharge. Heart rate 93 BPM. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to: A challenging but slow background noted prior to the Versed bolus. A periodic or pseudoperiodic complex noted in the background sometimes with a frontal sharp wave, sometimes with a vertex sharp wave. Absence of significant reactivity to tactile stimulation. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The pattern described above can be seen in the context of anoxic encephalopathy.  It can also be seen as a late status epilepticus pattern.  In this individual with a past history of epilepsy and a recent anoxic insult, additional EEG monitoring was initiated to clarify this finding October 7-8 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record demonstrates primarily a theta background.  Some sections of the record demonstrate significantly more muscle.  There is an underlying vertex sharp wave more apparent in some sections than others.  This sharp wave does not demonstrate frequency evolution.  The background does have some variability in that some sections including at 2:00 a.m. have a bit more continuous theta but at 6:00 a.m. there is more of a pattern of theta and then discontinuity.  On some occasions, tactile stimulation of the patient produced artifact but tactile stimulation of the patient did not produce an alerting response in the EEG. The clinical team noted that after the Versed drip was increased, the patient's eye blinking stopped.  No other involuntary movements were noted, and even though there were some sections of the record with some muscle artifact, when the patient receives nursing care, there is no change in EEG. By the end of the first 24 hours, the EEG is relatively continuous with brief attenuations but demonstrates frontal or vertex sharp waves.  At that juncture, the Versed drip is increased from 5 to 5.5 mg. October 7 through October 8, continuous video EEG monitoring:  Medications Depakote, Versed, others.  Introduction:  Continuous video EEG monitoring during this section of the recording is provided for a comatose, intubated woman without motor activity.  The EEG demonstrates an overall low voltage mixed theta with smaller amounts of delta pattern.  There is a subtle and prominent sharp wave noted in the frontocentral regions.  This is almost a vertex sharp wave, but in this section of the record the phase reversal is starting to shift just to the right of the midline; however, using an average reference this is now transitioned from a CZ sharp wave to an FV sharp wave with just a bit more spread to F4. In the overnight hours, the patient seems to have been dazed at around 3:00 a.m., producing a great deal of muscle. In the overnight recording, the frontal sharp wave seems to be fading.  The overall quality of the EEG starts to vary a bit, although there is no note as to whether or not the electrodes had been moved. By 4:30 a.m., the FV sharp wave is noted, and at this point it is a bit more prominent at F3 than F4.  The sharp wave is becoming less continuous, seen about once every second by 5:30 a.m.  At 6:03 a.m., tactile stimulation of the patient does not seem to activate the record.  The sharp wave does not evolve.  No note is made as to whether or not there has been additional changes in the patient's medications, but the background EEG which accompanies the sharp wave include a little less theta and a bit more arrhythmic delta with intermittent attenuations. EKG:  NA. INTERVAL IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring for this patient with an anoxic insult and post-anoxic ocular jerking demonstrates a pattern of fading periodic complexes.  These complexes have a complex feel of spread, maximum at the midline at CZ and then transitioning to FV.  By the end of the 2-day recording, the activity appeared to be less epileptiform in nature and the overall periodicity was fading. No evolving seizures were identified. October 8-9 INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and comatose.  No involuntary eye twitching was noted, but sometimes the patient was observed to have stiffening of the jaw.  Corneal and pupillary reflexes were absent. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although there are some sections of the record somewhat obscured by muscle, the overall 24-hour recording includes a now frontally predominant, more generalized periodic complex.  The periodic complexes transition from a CZ complex to more of a frontal complex.  There is occasional asymmetry, but it is generally frontally predominant. Vecuronium was provided to eliminate muscle and to confirm the cerebral nature of the complex. Over this 24-hour section the EEG activity is increasingly blunted with a more of a periodic sharp than a spike, lower voltage activity, and slowing of the periodic complex with sometimes as few as 2 in a 10-second period and at the very end of the recording 1 in a 10-second period. Heart rate:  80 BPM. IMPRESSION:  This multi-day long term video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for: A generalized periodic complex with an initial somewhat PLEDs pattern. Slowing of the periodic activity. Progressive background suppression. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe, anoxic insult.  The overall pattern is a pattern of thick lining cortical function.\""

The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There were no activating procedures.  No normal sleep architecture is seen. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves seen at T5 and at times moved more forward to T3 and very rarely at T6. Focal slowing seen at T5 frequently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts. Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts. There were intermittent bursts of prolonged lasting frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA). SEIZURES:  None. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterotemporal and midtemporal sharp waves with rare right posterotemporal sharp waves in addition to generalized slowing of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the left posterotemporal or even the right posterotemporal region. There is also evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left posterotemporal region , which is non-specific with regards to etiology.  Lastly there is evidence of  generalized cerebral dysfunction, of which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures were seen.'"

      "text/plain": "\" TYPE OF STUDY:  Portable EEG. CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 36-year-old man with past medical history of meningoencephalitis, mentally challenged with frequent seizures.  Patient had 1 episode of seizure in the morning on the day of this study. MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Keppra, Ativan, and phenobarbital. INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed at the bedside setting using the standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to one channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures the patient in an obtunded state. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the obtunded state, there was diffuse slowing of background activity in delta and at times in theta range.  There were some sleep structures characterized as spindles noted bilaterally.  There were occasional bursts of frontal intermittent delta activity (FIRDA) seen with a frequency of 1-1.5 Hz and an amplitude of 80-100 microvolts lasting for 1-2 seconds.  There were also occasional sharp and wave discharges seen in bitemporal areas most pronounced on the left side with a frequency of 0.8-1 Hz with no evolution or electrographic seizures.  Heart rate was 70-80. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in an obtunded state due to: 1. Diffuse slowing of background activity. 2. Occasional bitemporal sharp wave discharges with no evolution and no electrographic seizures, more pronounced on the left side. 3. Occasional bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activities(FIRDA) CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to postictal state, sedating medications, bilateral cerebral dysfunction, degenerative brain disease, epileptiform abnormalities as sharp discharges is indicative of cortical irritability in temporal regions most pronounced on the left side.  The FIRDA burst could be due to increased intracranial pressure, metabolic encephalopathy, or a deep midline lesions in the brain or degenerative brain disease.  The presence of sharp waves indicative of cortical irritability that places the patient at risk for seizures.  No electrographic seizures or clinical seizures noted during this recording.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures. Clinical correlation is recommended.\""

CT scan shows ongoing edema. MEDICATIONS: Propofol titrating up to 70 mcg and Versed starting at 10:00 AM, titrating up to 10 mg per hour by 2:00 PM.  Additional medications include Ceftriaxone, Fentanyl, Ativan, Mannitol, and Valproate. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is observed to have eye twitching in the beginning of the recording and tongue movements, but no additional motor activity is seen later on in the recording. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial sections of the record, the background demonstrates an ongoing ictal pattern starting at 10:00 AM.  The activity begins to slow to some degree by 12:57 with intermittent suppression.  This improves a small amount by 1:00 PM. The EEG is remarkable for the elimination of an ongoing ictal pattern with the eventual appearance of a burst suppression pattern around 1500 hours.  No additional changes in the pharmacotherapy are recorded on the computerized flow sheet. HR:  100 BPM. IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this section of the record demonstrates successful achievement of a burst suppression pattern after 1500 hours, with a clear sustained burst suppression pattern after 17:11.  In the time periods between 1700 hours and 10:00 AM, the EEG is occasionally continuous but there are no additional sustained seizures recorded. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 2, 2006 to March 3, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Propofol with doses ranging from 40 to 70 mg/hr and Midazolam at 10 to 14 mg/hr. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the ICU.  The patient is described as comatose without motor activity. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intermittently discontinuous pattern.  There are some portions of the record with arrhythmic delta and intermittent frontal fast activity.  Other portions demonstrate more significant, sustained mixed theta and alpha frequency activity.  No sustained ictal discharges are noted.  The patient is unplugged on the morning of the 3rd at approximately 4:50 AM.  Prior to this, the EEG was continuous with frontal delta, and there is a little low voltage discrete bursts of fast activity picked at the midline.  In this section of the record, they are most prominent in the frontal not the parietal regions. HR: 100 BPM. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 3, 2006 to March 4, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Midazolam drip at 14 mg/hr, Propofol wean, Valproate, and others. INTRODUCTION: Ongoing, continuous video EEG monitoring is performed for this comatose patient at the bedside, approximately three to four days following an anoxic injury.  The patient is described as comatose without obvious motor responses. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, until approximately 5:00 or 7:00 PM, the patient is on a Propofol wean and Midazolam at 14 mg/hr.  The EEG demonstrates initially sometimes a burst suppression pattern and at other times a more continuous pattern with mixed theta and delta.  This EEG is unique in that there is at times a vertex positive wave and at other times there seems to be some fast activity at P3.  As the recording continues, there is both some muscle artifact picked up in the EEG, although none can be seen at the bedside.  In addition, the fast activity and the positive sharp waves seem to be a bit more prominent. HR: 114 BPM. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 4, 2006 to March 5, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Midazolam, Valproate, and others. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the ICU for this individual now five to six days status-post anoxic injury.  The patient remains comatose, intubated with ocular myoclonus. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  Some portions of the record demonstrate a pattern with delta activity.  In the sections with delta, there is occasionally fast activity identified in the frontal regions. There are also occasional positive sharp waves at Cz and also negative sharp waves at Cz.  Throughout the record, there are intermittent bursts of fast activity with approximately an alpha frequency activity or occasional brief bursts of beta activity.  These tend to be maximum at the midline and include the frontocentral region. There are no clinical events suggestive of seizures. Reviewing the seizure detector, there are occasional bursts of paroxysmal fast activity, some of which are discrete in onset, others which are more variable in onset at times lasting 40 to 50 seconds and others more brief.  One specific example is seen at 23:33:05.  Some of these have a clear, abrupt termination as would be expected to be seen in an ictal discharge.  These are identified on Saturday, March 4, at 11:41, 14:31, 15:26, 21:53, 23:32, and 1:36 AM on Sunday.  They are a little less remarkable on the Sunday recording, but can be seen at 3:32, 4:28, 9:55, 10:35, 11:34, and 12:14. No clear changes were made in the patientâ\\x80\\x99s sedative hypnotic medications with these discharges. HR: 114 BPM. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 5, 2006 to March 6, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Midazolam, Valproate, Topiramate, and others. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is comatose with eye flutter to tactile stimulation only. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG from the 5th to the 6th demonstrates a pattern of ongoing irritability â\\x80\\x93 in fact, increasing irritability.  The electropositive sharp wave at Cz can be identified and there are brief bursts of fast activity.  Although seizures are not always easy to identify in terms of onset and off set, there are a handful of more well-defined seizures including 21:09, 8:01 AM, 8:43, and 01:45.  These are characterized by an increase in fast activity, sometimes with alpha and theta frequency activity, which is sustained, and by abrupt paroxysmal termination of the activity followed by slowing. The patient can be seen to be stimulated on multiple occasions during this recording session, but there is no clear change.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to see the video of her ocular stimulation. HR: 114 BPM. IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this section of the record is remarkable for an increase in fast activity, positive sharp waves, and an evolving, faster frequency activity. One-Hour EEG Monitoring, March 6, 2006 â\\x80\\x93 12:45 to 1:45 MEDICATIONS: Versed, Valproate, Topiramate, and others. INTRODUCTION: One-hour video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the ICU. The patient is comatose.  She is examined by the team during the study. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a mixture of delta and theta.  There is occasional fast activity noted occurring in bursts, lasting less than one second in duration.  In addition, there are occasional positive sharp waves.  There is variability in the record with some sections showing more or less delta than others.  Stimulation of the patient does seem to elicit the positive sharp waves, but not the fast activity. HR: 120 BPM. IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This one-hour EEG demonstrates a pattern of background slowing.  The bursts of paroxysmal fast and electropositive sharp waves with sharp activity picked up in the frontocentral and centrotemporal regions suggests ongoing cortical irritability.'"

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old woman with a history of seizures, hepatitis C, drug abuse on methadone, who presents with complaints of heart racing, dizzy, feeling shaky with no loss of consciousness.  She has had seizures for 9 years, last one was 1 week ago. MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, aspirin, Lovenox, gabapentin, zonisamide. INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with a lead anterior temporal and a single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact intermittently. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges.  Throughout the recording, the patient has intermittent bouts of nystagmoid eye movements while her eyes are closed. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal sharp wave seen at 01 intermittently, in addition to focal slowing seen at also 01-02 in the parietal region at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV. SEIZURES:  The patient had a seizure at 1:19:46 p.m. which clinically the patient appears to move her head to the left and then to the right.  Then suddenly her eyes deviate towards the right and her head starts turning towards the right while her hands are clenched in front of her.  She remains in a stiff posturing with her eyes deviated to the right and her head deviated to the right throughout the entire seizure.  She intermittently swallows while this is occurring and smacks her lips.  It appears that at 1:21:20, the seizure ends electrographically, however, clinically she continues to stare and appears to continue to lip smack and mumbles.  The patient remains confused until almost the end of the recording. EEG:  It appears the electrographic onset to be a sudden change in attenuation over the right hemisphere, losing the posterior dominant frequency.  This continues to evolve with frontal theta discharge that appears as the patient starts moving her head to the right, then spreads to the occipital region on the left hemisphere.  It continues to quickly increase and evolve amplitude and decrease in frequency until it is obscured by muscle artifact.  There is a buildup and spread of this rhythmicity and which suddenly it stops and is followed by diffuse slowing with intermixed muscle artifact on the EEG. Heart rate 84. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a single seizure, of unclear origin, in addition to some left occipital sharp waves and slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with a single seizure of unclear origin. In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction and irritability in the left occipital area.'"

The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Intermittent low to moderate amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves were captured over the left occipital region with maximal scalp negativity over O1 electrode.  Additionally, several generalized spikes with after-going slow waves, most pronounced over the right frontal region are captured.  Several seizures are captured.  Electrographically these seizures are characterized by sudden diffuse voltage attenuation and appearance of generalized beta/fast activity.  On a single occasion such activity is preceded by generalized high amplitude spike and wave activity.  As this voltage attenuation and fast activity progresses rhythmic teeth grinding artifact is observed.  Clinically the patient starts moving and has occasional gaze deviation towards the left.  There are several such electrographic seizures during the recording.  These seizures have poor offset.  They lasted for approximately 2 minutes. FINDINGS: Several seizures, likely neocortical in origin with poor offset, lasting approximately 2 minutes and clinically associated with rhythmic teeth grinding artifact and possibly gaze deviation towards the left. Left occipital sharp waves. Rare generalized spikes with after-going slow waves, most pronounced over right frontal region. Moderate diffuse slowing. IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21-minute EEG due to several seizures likely neocortical in origin, intermittent left occipital epileptiform discharges, several generalized spike and waves, and moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Epileptiform discharges indicate likely multi-focal onset epilepsy.

Prior to that the patient was receiving propofol. CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Additional chin EMG lead was applied.  The recording was performed at the bedside.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  At the beginning of the recording diffuse rhythmic and semi-rhythmic muscle artifact is noted.  This artifact resolves once vecuronium is administered.

She has a past medical history of being a drug abuser, HIV, diabetes, hypertension, COPD, emphysema, hepatitis B, asthma, heart disease and obese. MEDICATIONS:  Patient does receive Depakote and Versed during the recording. INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed from 06/19/2013 to 06/20/2013 for 16 hours using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system and single of EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed. Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection itself as well as nurses events and personal review of the EEG was performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record has a background that appears to have no normal organization or posterior dominant rhythm or frontal center beta.  Overall, there is a diffuse mainly alpha pattern seen throughout the recording in all electrodes, mainly in the frontal electrodes which is suggestive of an alpha pattern.  There is no normal sleep architecture, no activating procedures were performed. Abnormal discharges:  Diffuse alpha frequency throughout the entire recording. Seizures:  During the recording, the EEG will reveal intermittent infrequent irregular central sharp waves that slowly start increasing in frequency and amplitude and over the period of an hour, evolving to diffuse central frontal predominant spike in wave discharge, that is present throughout the entire brain. This pattern again lasts up to an hour and has no clear clinical correlate.  On the 2 occasions where this pattern occurred in this recording, it was stopped with the use of Versed.  Again, a background in between the seizures will be the one described before. Heart rate:  120. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized electrographic non convulsive seizures.  In addition to abnormal background most consistent with alpha coma. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of non convulsive status epilepticus with generalized onset pattern.  In addition, the background is suggestive of an alpha pattern which has a poor prognosis.  However, the medications may have some part in the presentation of this background and no clear or final prognostic indicators or indications can be given.

Nursing- initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending # Push button events Description of pushbutton events Multiple events occurred from sleep. Description: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear followed quickly by moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes. Frequent focal sharp waves are present in the right anterior temporal region, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F8/T2. Independent occasional focal sharp waves are present in the left temporal region, with phase reversal and  amplitude maximum at F7/T1. While asleep there were multiple frequent bilateral frontal high amplitude delta discharges that increase in amplitude and then decrease in frequency to a theta discharge which are best seen in the prefrontal  leads. These may last up to a minute. Clinically the patient may open her eyes and either hand may assume a dystonic posture or both may become stiff.  Sometimes she wipes her nose or face with either hand.  These episodes are all consistent with focal seizures.

HR is 84  On 11/15/2013 at around 10:49 the EEG suddenly reveals a diffuse high amplitude monomorphic rhythmic delta that last for about 4 minutes. This occurred while the patient was in the bathroom and off the camera. The RN reports that the patient suddenly became pale then slumped on the side and became unresponsive. Once the patient was placed on the floor she regained consciousness.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 18-year-old woman with a history of seizures since age 2, seizure free until age 10, began to have seizures during sleep every night.  Reports tongue biting, bladder incontinence, and no recall of events. MEDICATIONS:  Carbatrol. INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed including photic stimulation and hyperventilation. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The records reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation. Abnormal discharges: Frequent focal sharp waves seen at F7/T4 at times with a more posterior component at T6 and sometimes more of anterior component at FP2.  These occurred frequently during wakefulness and sleep. Focal sharp waves seen rarely at F7/T3 during wakefulness and sleep. Seizures:  One seizure occurred at 9:48:10 a.m. where the patient suddenly while asleep opened her eyes and appears to be startled.  She moves her eyes to the right and turns her head to the right and starts moaning.  Next, her right arm starts shaking back and forth and she continues to do this for some seconds until her shoulders start shaking and then she starts shaking the left arm.  Next, the head moves to the left and then she starts moving side to side while moaning.  At this point the left hand appears to be having some automatisms and she starts arching her back until the seizure ends. Electrographically at the onset of the seizure there appeared to be a bilateral prefrontal discharge which only causes the left hemisphere to become attenuated and muscle artifact starts forming.  At that point central alpha discharge is noticed, specifically a CZ, which then involves into a diffuse theta and delta slowing seen in both hemispheres.  As the patient's head moves side to side, the rhythmicity continues to evolve and suddenly stops.  Afterwards there is diffuse slowing. Heart rate:  108. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right, much more than left, anterior temporal sharp waves and a single seizure of unclear onset, but appears to be possibly left prefrontal with quick spread centrally. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from either anterior temporal lobe or the frontal lobe.\""

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old man with CAD, schizophrenia, COPD, and cocaine use who presents with recurrent change in mental status, ingestion of Vick's Vaporub, and recurrent seizures. MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, phenobarbital, propofol, dopamine. INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact in the ear (A,- A2) electrodes halfway through the recording. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm and mainly diffuse beta continuously seen.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.  Overall there appears to be an overriding beta and background slowing underneath the diffuse beta. Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen frequently over F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts. Seizures:  The patient has recurrent electrographic seizures that appear to have an unclear onset but mainly seem to develop from a beta discharge in the prefrontal region, mainly at FP1, which quickly spreads to the contralateral hemisphere and is obscured by muscle artifact.  Afterward there is diffuse delta that remains slightly more prominently over the left hemisphere until it dissipates.  The average seizure lasts about 2 minutes.  During the first recording, he was having about 5 or 6 seizures per hour.  As the time goes along, it decreases to 5, then 4 seizures per hour.  The last hour that they stopped, from 1:00 to 2:00 a.m., he has about 3 seizures.  After that there are no more seizures seen.  During the seizures, it is hard to clearly see any clear correlation in the video, but there appears to be some muscle artifact seen, noted in the EEG as described above, consistent with an EEG clinical correlate.  After 2:00 a.m., no seizures were seen.  Some burst suppression is noted, but mainly the same background remains. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multiple recurrent seizures of unclear onset, but possibly left prefrontal region with additional left anterior temporal focal slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of status epilepticus with multiple seizures possibly arising from the left prefrontal region, which appears to have stopped by 2:00 a.m.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  Lastly, the diffuse beta may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  There is underlying generalized slowing which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  Please note that the findings on this EEG were communicated to the primary team throughout the night at intervals.\""

Most seizures occur at night, right arm stiffens and the patient reaches for his left hand, is unable to speak, no definitive loss of consciousness.  Total seizure duration 1 minute. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase of rhythmic theta.  In stage I sleep, there are vertex waves.  Vertex waves seem to be slightly asymmetric with a field that is maximum on the right on some occasions.  There is also a subtle shifting asymmetry noted in the right and left central regions in sleep. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. In photic stimulation, the patient is drifting in and out of sleep but there seems to be a vertex wave, again somewhat asynchronous and in this case at CZC3 during photic stimulation. Heart rate 78 beats per minute. IMPRESSION:  This is a somewhat unusual, unlikely abnormal electroencephalogram for an adult of this age due to:  Vertex activity with shifting asymmetry but often with a localization to the right of the midline. Clinical correlation:  In this young adult with a question of extra temporal epilepsy, the asymmetry described above may reflect either an asymmetry in the appearance of vertex activity or an underlying midline sharp which is under-recognized.  There is a suggestion on only 1 occasion of a sharp wave just to the left of midline.  A follow-up study with additional electrodes would be of value.'"

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This patient was briefly off the monitor for MRI and then placed back on. The patient's Versed doses had been reduced during the monitoring.  The patient had remained poorly responsive, but during the EEG had a single episode of right shoulder twitching at approximately 1:08 p.m. on the 1st. DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The initial sections of this last day of recording include a left occipital sharp waves or spike, which is somewhat periodic in nature.  Also, evolving out of this record is lower voltage fast activity from the left central or frontal central region.  This section of the record demonstrates a more clear breach rhythm with higher amplitude slowing on the left compared to the right, but the overall pattern is quite slow. At 12:48 p.m., there is more muscle artifact noted.  The respiratory therapist is working with the event and looking at the video, there is muscle artifact, but there is a question of both rhythmic theta in the left frontal central region and muscle artifact on the right.  Looking at the video, it is very difficult to see a clinical features of the seizure.  At 12:52, the nurse comes to check on the patient and somewhere along this time the nurse identifies a clinical seizure.  There is clear muscle artifact noted just before 1 a.m., but the likely event may have been at 1:08 or 1:05.  The nurse were called twitching of the upper arm, which is harder to see on the video, but it does look like there may have been a flicker of movement in the face at that time. No additional clinical twitching was noted and the Versed drip was adjusted subsequently.  Subsequent sections of the record demonstrate a more suppressed overall background with the occipital spikes and sharp waves previously noted.  Some of these briefly have a field at T2. As the recording continues, the overall EEG is much slower.  There has been a transition with this record with epileptiform activity from the left occipital region, which now seems to have a field on the right, not previously noted. Heart rate 88. IMPRESSION:  This is the last day of continuous EEG monitoring for this patient.  It is remarkable for: A refractory epileptiform pattern with epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere.  There appears to be more than 1 area substantially epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere, left frontocentral, and left occipital temporal. A clinical seizures are more localizing to the left motor, supplementary motor with twitching of the face, arm, and pectoralis. In this very ill patient, correlation with the posterior epileptiform activity is more challenging. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is compatible with that refractory performed with status epilepticus.  Uses of high doses of sedative hypnotic medications and transformation to a burst suppression pattern were helpful, but as can be seen on April 1st, reduction of medications is associated with recurrence of the focal motor seizures. __________________________\""

Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG was available at the bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses and EEG technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the # Push button events Description of pushbutton events Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-30uV, 11-12Hz activity diffusely.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is no clinical or electrographic sleep seen. No focal slowing is present.  No inter-ictal epileptiform discharges are present.  Between 2:46PM and 6:08PM there are several clinical seizures observed and detected by bedside video EEG. These consist clinically of motor arrest, tachycardia, and eye deviation to the right.  These are accompanied by a buildup of rhythmic, sharply contoured theta activity over the left fronto- temporal region. The theta evolves in 3Hz delta activity and then stops spontaneously.  Each of these seizures lasts 1.5-2 minutes and then there is return to background baseline activity. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Summary of Findings: Beta, excessive, bilateral diffuse Seizure, intermittent, left frontotemporal Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour video EEG due to diffuse beta activity and at least 6 left fronto- temporal seizures. Diffuse beta activity may reflect a medication side effect. In the absence of a return to intact mental status, recurrent seizures may represent status epilepticus.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.'"

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDS: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside In the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was awake but confused. Electrode locations were modified because of the patients recent biopsy. In addition, it was not possible to achieve adequate impedances at all electrodes due to the patient's fragile skin. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial seconds of the EEG are technically quite challenging with a great deal of muscle and movement artifact. When awake, the patient is answering questions appropriately. When unstimulated, the background EEG is diffusely slow with prominent mixtures of 2 Hz delta and 5 Hz theta. In addition, there is an asymmetry in the theta activity, which is a bit more prominent in the right hemisphere than the left. The frontal delta is higher amplitude on the right compared to the left. Heart rate 96 bpm. IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG due to: IMPRESSION: 1. Marked background slowing. 2. An asymmetry with disruption of the theta frequency activity on the left compared to the right 3. Frontally predominant rhythmic delta, right greater than left. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This individual is awake but confused. She demonstrated some lip smacking behaviors during the EEG, but they did not carry an EEG signature. Because of the concern for subtle underlying seizures, additional EEG long-term recording was requested.\""

Last seizures occurred 2 years ago. MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lamictal. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  During wakefulness, there were 2 bursts of generalized spike and wave, and polyspike discharges seen occurrent with a frequency of 3.5 Hz, which were frontally predominant.  These occurred in bursts lasting for 1-2 seconds.  There was no clinical seizure correlated during these bursts.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response without any photoparoxysmal response.  Hyperventilation was performed and results in symmetric slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep due to generalized spike and wave and polyspike discharges seen during wakefulness. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in the setting of a history of seizures.  Clinical correlation is recommended.'"

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software as well as patient-reported events and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening and a normal frontocentral beta.  The patient reveals normal architecture of sleep. Seizures:  During the recording, again specifically at the early stages of the recording there is rhythmic theta to alpha rhythm that is right hemispheric predominant at times, maximal at F4, and sometimes becomes more generalized, that is continuously occurring for hours.  This pattern waxes and wanes in frequency, again going anywhere from 5 Hz to 9 Hz diffusely, but again maximally at times in the frontal region, specifically in the right hemisphere at F4.  During this pattern, the patient is tested and appears to be able to answer all questions except 3-step commands or complex math.  The patient is given a dose of Ativan 2 mg IV, which appeared to have no effect on the pattern.  Later on, the patient was given a dose of Depakote, which appeared to, about an hour later, start to have an effect on the EEG, which appeared to improve.  Overnight, actually the EEG looked much improved and normalized to a normal EEG pattern, and the rest of the recording after about 10:00 p.m. remained normal until the next day.

The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1/T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of periods of diffuse voltage attenuation lasting from several seconds to approximately 12-15 seconds, followed by progressive onset of bifrontal slow delta activity that increases in frequency and amplitude and spreads diffusely.  These episodes occur throughout the recording.  When the patient is stimulated diffuse voltage attenuation was achieved.  Due to the recurrent nature of these episodes, I suspect that these represent recurrent seizures.  No abnormal sleep architecture is captured. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. FINDINGS:  Status epilepticus. IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21-minute EEG due to suspected status epilepticus involving bifrontal regions.  However, at least on several occasions, during the recording this discrete EEG pattern could be elicited by stimulation.  Therefore, it is also possible that these episodes represent forms of reactivity.  The findings were communicated to the neurology consult team.\""

A stage I sleep was characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of eye blink and muscle artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Slow-wave sleep and REM sleep were also captured.  Focal slow waves seen rarely at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolt. Clinical events:  On 08/14/2013 at 05:37 a.m., there was a push button event as the patient experienced 1 episode of missing time, slurred speech, disorientation.  There were no EEG ictal changes associated with this event. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal video EEG monitoring study due to rare left focal slowing at F7/T3.  Patient had 1 event as described above during this recording while she was awake and reports 1 episode of missing time with disorientation.  This event was associated with no ictal change on EEG. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal slowing could be due to structural or functional dysfunction of underlying brain in the subcortical white matter in the left hemisphere.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  Patient had 1 event of missing time and disorientation for a few minutes with no EEG correlations.  This is one of the typical event that patient experiences as a seizure activity.  The capturing of missing time and confusion without any associated ictal change on EEG may be suggestive of a simple partial seizure since simple partial seizures are not always captured on scalp EEG or it could be suggestive of a nonepileptic event.  This EEG monitoring does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy since all of the patient's habitual events have not been captured.  If seizure remain a clinical concern, a repeat video EEG monitoring may be helpful.\""

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 45-year-old, right-handed male with a history of epilepsy since age 13.  Per his sister it is a posttraumatic seizure.  The patient initially had drop attacks for several seconds with multiple head injuries. The patient also had a history of near drowning. MEDICATIONS:  Divalproex, carbamazepine, simvastatin. INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at lab using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system and additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Due to cognitive dysfunction the patient was not able to cooperate with hyperventilations. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDS:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7-7.5 Hz in frequency, seen in the occipital region, which mildly attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  During wakefulness and sleep, there were frequent bursts of generalized sharp and slow-wave discharges seen with a frequency of 2-2.5 Hz, which were frontally predominant.  They occurred at times in burst lasting from 1-6 seconds.  The bursts were longer during sleep.  There was no clinical seizures correlate during these bursts.  The patient also had disorganized background activity with excess theta and at times, with a frequency of 5-7 Hz and at times delta activity most pronounced during sleep.  Drowsiness and sleep were characterized by slowing of background activity, and absence of eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Photic stimulation was performed and results in no driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed results in diffuse slowing in the background activity.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing and at times disorganized background activity to frequent diffuse sharp and slow wave discharges, 2.5 Hz infrequency, with no evolution at times in bursts most pronounced during sleep. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy likely Lennox, gastaut syndrome in the setting of a history of seizures. Diffuse slowing indicate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to the etiology.'"

Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist. # Push button events Description of pushbutton events Description: There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Early in the recording the background consists of  of up to 3-4Hz frontally predominant rhythmic moderate amplitude generalized sharp waves that are admixed with underriding delta activity.  As the recording progresses, the background changes to a mixture of theta and alpha activity with frequent bifrontal blunted sharp waves.  No normal sleep architecture There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  There is continuous C4, Fz, Cz and Pz lead artifact. Summary of Findings: Status epilepticus, myoclonic, resolves by the end of the recording No reactivity Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL ~24-hour continuous video EEG due to presence of myoclonic status epilepticus that improves as the recording progresses. This finding indicates marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction and cortical excitability.  Resolution of the status epilepticus could be related to escalation of medical care vc worsening cerebral injury.  '"

INTRODUCTION:  A 22-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically challenging EEG with the patient, who demonstrated poor cooperativity.  The patient's mother was present during the EEG.  The mother notes that the patient's seizures are associated with head dropping.  This patient was very drowsy, drifting in and out of sleep and the mother described some of this patient's behaviors as compatible with his typical seizure. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG background is markedly abnormal, lacking the normal developmental milestones for an awake adult.  The overall background could best be characterized as lower voltage beta with bursts of rhythmic delta. Epileptiform discharges in this record include bursts of 4 Hz activity, which can be primarily in the right hemisphere or bilateral.

On another occasion, there is a more prolonged bursts of right hemispheric 4-5 Hz activity without the same clearly defined delta.  A more sustained bursts of frontal delta with fast activity mixed in, was not associated with clear clinical signs.  The patient seemed to be hyperextending the neck, drifting off to sleep in the chair and moving about, but the mother did not consider this as one of the patient's typical seizures.  Notched, frontally predominant delta with a subtle underlying spike in wave discharge was also noted in the background.  These bursts were typically less than a second in duration.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This report includes 48 hours of continuous video EEG monitoring using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  There were daily practice pushbuttons.  Seizure and spike detection software was utilized. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  October 3rd to October 4th:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-developed alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  In drowsiness, wicket activity as well as prominent, 5 hertz rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness was noted. Sleep was characterized by abundant beta activity and spindles.  Sleep was relatively fragmented and snoring was noted. Seizures:  None. Epileptiform Activity:  None. Practice push buttons: 11:59 and 8 p.m.  No epileptiform features noted at this time. EEG monitoring during this section of the record did not identify epileptiform activity. October 4th to October 5th:  During this section of the record, the patient had 1 clinical event at 11 p.m. on the night of the 4th. Background:  In sleep, there is abundant beta activity.  No transition in and out of sleep, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness was noted.  The awake record is well organized with symmetric reactive alpha rhythm. Interictal epileptiform abnormalities:  None. Epileptiform seizures:  None. Event:  11p.m., the patient had been asleep.  She seems to be somewhat drowsy.  Prior to the event, significant noise can be appreciated in the hallway, which has made it difficult to sleep.  By 10:46, there is eye opening noted.  The event is at 11 p.m.  The patient is noted to be breathing heavily, somewhat restless.  The patient pushes the button.  The nurses enter the room.  The patient is breathing heavily.  She is not conversing with the nurses, but she is following commands.  Altered and somewhat peculiar behavior is noted and at 11:02, the patient is crying and moaning.

She was noted to have a finger stick in the 400s and complex partial seizures.\\tMedication was uptitrated and she was transferred to Temple Ho.spital for video EEG monitoring and further management. MEDICATIONS : Prior to arrival: Keppra 750 mg q12h Dilantin 500 mg load Received Ativan 2 mg prior to study Received Ativan 2 mg during day 1 SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram {EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. Events were marked by the clinical staff. All clinical events as well as extensive random background samples including wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep were reviewed. DAY 1 {9/28/2015, 20:59 - 9/29/2015, 08:00) On Keppra 750 mg q12h Received Dilantin load, free level 2.3 by 0300 9/29/2015 BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, asymmetric, and fairly organized. The left hemisphere consists of alpha with a moderate amount of frontal beta. The right hemisphere consists of a more attenuated, less organized mixture of alpha and beta. Posterior dominant rhythm was not present. The background is reactive and variable. Following the administration of Ativan there is excess of beta frequencies . There is mild generalized slowing. There is continuous bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing. Sleep is characterized by further slowing of the background. PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present EVENTS: (1) DATE AND TIME:\\t9/28/2015 at 20:59 EVENT TYPE: Complex partial seizure CLINICAL: The patient is lying in bed. About 15 seconds into the electrographic onset (perhaps longer, as this seizure begins when the study is first connected), she has forced left head deviation followed by rhythmic twitching of her head towards the left. Eyes are closed. Arms not well seen. Following resolution of ictal EEG activity patient is somnolent, responses are dysarthric, and she follows commands slowly. EEG: Note that this seizure begins just as the EEG is connected for the start of the study; consequently the first ictal EEG change may not be captured. At onset, there is low amplitude beta activity over the right posterior quadrant (T6/P4/02 > T4/C4). This activity increases in amplitude and slows in frequency to sharply contoured alpha and spreads to the left posterior quadrant (T5/P3/0l). 18 seconds into electrographic onset the posterior ictal activity slows to alpha-theta frequencies with admixed spikes.\\tDiffuse muscle artifact is seen over left hemispheric leads that breaks up into clonic muscle activity simultaneously there is spike and wave seen over the right hemisphere. This activity slows to 1.5 Hz delta (sharply contoured) . DURATION: 64 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES: Focal slowing is present over the bilateral posterior quadrants, R>L EKG: single lead is obscured (2) DATE AND TIME:\\t9/28/2015 at 21:48 EVENT TYPE: Complex partial seizure CLINICAL: Similar to #1. Lying in bed w/ eyes closed. Left arm elevates 32 seconds into electrographic onset, she has forced head turn to left, then rhythmic twitching of left arm and head (to the left). EEG: Similar to #1, beginning with low amplitude beta activity over right posterior quadrant for -3.5 seconds, then increasing in amplitude and evolving as described in #1. DURATION: 1 min 28 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES:\\tFocal slowing is present over the bilateral posterior quadrants, R>L EKG: No definite change in heart rate (3) DATE AND TIME:\\t9/29/2015 at 05:25 EVENT TYPE: Complex partial seizure CLINICAL: Asleep in bed.\\tHas a few possible eye flutters -75-90 seconds into electrographic onset EEG: Similar to above seizures, but without muscle artifact. Low amplitude beta activity seen over right posterior quadrant leads for 2.5 seconds, then increases in amplitude and evolves as described for above 2 seizures DURATION: 2 min 11 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES:\\tMuch less pronounced than above 2 seizures EKG: no change DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to: Mild generalized slowing Suboptimal background organization Right hemisphere attenuation of faster frequencies Three complex partial seizures arising from the right posterior quadrant These findings are significant for right posterior quadrant focal seizures, right hemisphere dysfunction, and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. DAY 2 (9/29/2015, 08:00 - 9/30/2015, 08:00) BACKGROUND: Left hemisphere: fair organization with mixture .of alpha, beta, theta Right hemisphere: fair organization with mixture of alpha, beta; faster frequencies are attenuated Sleep is characterized by further background slowing. Over the course of this day rudimentary K complexes are seen in sleep. GENERALIZED SLOWING: mild FOCAL SLOWING: continuous bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing Attenuation of faster frequencies over right hemisphere PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION No seizures Background organization somewhat improved, though still suboptimal. Bilateral posterior quadrant focal slowing continues to be seen. DAY 3 (9/30/2015, 08:00 - 10/1/2015, 08:00) BACKGROUND: No change GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change FOCAL SLOWING: Continuous bilateral posterior quadrant slowing - better seen over left posterior quadrant Attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere PROXIMAL ACTIVITY  (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare poorly defined sharp waves over left occipital region Rare diffuse generalized rhythmic delta activity at 1 Hz for <5 second periods EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Focal slowing over the posterior quadrants is often better seen over LEFT hemisphere, though it is present over right as well. Continuous\\tattenuation of faster frequencies over right hemisphere as seen previously Rare epileptogenic potentials over left occipital region, poorly defined and broadly distributed. Generalized rhythmic delta activity is a nonspecific but pathologic finding that may be seen in encephalopathic states. DAY 4 (10/1/2015, 08:00 - 10/2/2015, 08:00) BACKGROUND: no change GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change FOCAL SLOWING: no change PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: 1. Rare poorly defined sharp waves over left occipital region EVENTS: (1) DATE AND TIME:\\t10/1/2015 at 11:04 EVENT TYPE: other CLINICAL: There was no visible clinical or behavioral change seen.

EEG: No ictal epileptic EEG correlate is present DURATION: unclear (2) DATE AND TIME:\\t10/1/2015 at 12:42 EVENT TYPE: other CLINICAL: Patient is lying supine in bed and tells the nurse she urinated. Nurse pushes button. EEG: No ictal epileptic EEG correlate is present DURATION: unclear DAY 4 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION Little change from previous day, except for resolution of generalized rhythmic delta activity. DAY 5 (10/2/2015, 06:00 - 10/2/2015 16:03) BACKGROUND: Improvement in degree of background slowing and organization as follows: Left hemisphere has fair organization with a rare posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz Right hemisphere demonstrates no posterior dominant rhythm but has fair organization GENERALIZED SLOWING: Mild FOCAL SLOWING: There is a lesser degree of focal slowing in both posterior quadrants. Continuous theta-delta slowing is seen in both posterior quadrants, more prominent on left. PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none EVENTS: (1) DATE AND TIME:\\t10/2/2015 at 08:39 EVENT TYPE: other CLINICAL: There was no visible clinical or behavioral change seen. Patient sitting in chair off camera and\\treported \"seeing bugs\" flying out of the window. EEG: No ictal epileptic EEG correlate is present DURATION: unclear *Patient later clarifies that she has had this complaint chronically and has been told she has \"floaters.\" DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION There is improvement in the degree of background slowing and organization, as well as the bilateral posterior focal slowing. A definite posterior dominant rhythm is seen on the left today for the first time. FINAL IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to: Three focal seizures originating from the right posterior quadrant (9/28 x2, 9/29 xl) Rare poorly defined sharp waves over the left occipital region, seen on Days 3-4 Rare generalized rhythmic delta activity seen on Day 3 Bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing, worse at first over the right at the start of the study, but more pronounced on the left by the end of the study Right hemisphere attenuation/suboptimal organization, which Â· improves over the course of the study 5. Mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction with suboptimal organization, which improves over the\\tcourse of the study FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are significant for foal seizures over the right posterior quadrant and epileptogenic activity over the left posterior quadrant. There is also bilateral posterior quadrant cerebral dysfunction and right hemisphere dysfunction, superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction . The posterior quadrant and diffuse dysfunction improve over the course of the study. The seizures resolve by Day 2.'"

She was noted to have a finger stick in the 400s and complex partial seizures.\\tMedication was uptitrated and she was transferred to Temple Ho.spital for video EEG monitoring and further management. MEDICATIONS : Prior to arrival: Keppra 750 mg q12h Dilantin 500 mg load Received Ativan 2 mg prior to study Received Ativan 2 mg during day 1 SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE: A 21 channel electroencephalogram {EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG. Events were marked by the clinical staff. All clinical events as well as extensive random background samples including wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep were reviewed. DAY 1 {9/28/2015, 20:59 - 9/29/2015, 08:00) On Keppra 750 mg q12h Received Dilantin load, free level 2.3 by 0300 9/29/2015 BACKGROUND: The waking background is continuous, asymmetric, and fairly organized. The left hemisphere consists of alpha with a moderate amount of frontal beta. The right hemisphere consists of a more attenuated, less organized mixture of alpha and beta. Posterior dominant rhythm was not present. The background is reactive and variable. Following the administration of Ativan there is excess of beta frequencies . There is mild generalized slowing. There is continuous bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing. Sleep is characterized by further slowing of the background. PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present EVENTS: (1) DATE AND TIME:\\t9/28/2015 at 20:59 EVENT TYPE: Complex partial seizure CLINICAL: The patient is lying in bed. About 15 seconds into the electrographic onset (perhaps longer, as this seizure begins when the study is first connected), she has forced left head deviation followed by rhythmic twitching of her head towards the left. Eyes are closed. Arms not well seen. Following resolution of ictal EEG activity patient is somnolent, responses are dysarthric, and she follows commands slowly. EEG: Note that this seizure begins just as the EEG is connected for the start of the study; consequently the first ictal EEG change may not be captured. At onset, there is low amplitude beta activity over the right posterior quadrant (T6/P4/02 > T4/C4). This activity increases in amplitude and slows in frequency to sharply contoured alpha and spreads to the left posterior quadrant (T5/P3/0l). 18 seconds into electrographic onset the posterior ictal activity slows to alpha-theta frequencies with admixed spikes.\\tDiffuse muscle artifact is seen over left hemispheric leads that breaks up into clonic muscle activity simultaneously there is spike and wave seen over the right hemisphere. This activity slows to 1.5 Hz delta (sharply contoured) . DURATION: 64 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES: Focal slowing is present over the bilateral posterior quadrants, R>L EKG: single lead is obscured (2) DATE AND TIME:\\t9/28/2015 at 21:48 EVENT TYPE: Complex partial seizure CLINICAL: Similar to #1. Lying in bed w/ eyes closed. Left arm elevates 32 seconds into electrographic onset, she has forced head turn to left, then rhythmic twitching of left arm and head (to the left). EEG: Similar to #1, beginning with low amplitude beta activity over right posterior quadrant for -3.5 seconds, then increasing in amplitude and evolving as described in #1. DURATION: 1 min 28 sec POSTICTAL CHANGES:\\tFocal slowing is present over the bilateral posterior quadrants, R>L EKG: No definite change in heart rate (3) DATE AND TIME:\\t9/29/2015 at 05:25 EVENT TYPE: Complex partial seizure CLINICAL: Asleep in bed.\\tHas a few possible eye flutters -75-90 seconds into electrographic onset EEG: Similar to above seizures, but without muscle artifact.

DAY 2 (9/29/2015, 08:00 - 9/30/2015, 08:00) BACKGROUND: Left hemisphere: fair organization with mixture .of alpha, beta, theta Right hemisphere: fair organization with mixture of alpha, beta; faster frequencies are attenuated Sleep is characterized by further background slowing. Over the course of this day rudimentary K complexes are seen in sleep. GENERALIZED SLOWING: mild FOCAL SLOWING: continuous bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing Attenuation of faster frequencies over right hemisphere PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION No seizures Background organization somewhat improved, though still suboptimal.

Continuous\\tattenuation of faster frequencies over right hemisphere as seen previously Rare epileptogenic potentials over left occipital region, poorly defined and broadly distributed. Generalized rhythmic delta activity is a nonspecific but pathologic finding that may be seen in encephalopathic states.

EEG: No ictal epileptic EEG correlate is present DURATION: unclear *Patient later clarifies that she has had this complaint chronically and has been told she has \"floaters.\" DAY 5 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION There is improvement in the degree of background slowing and organization, as well as the bilateral posterior focal slowing. A definite posterior dominant rhythm is seen on the left today for the first time. FINAL IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to: Three focal seizures originating from the right posterior quadrant (9/28 x2, 9/29 xl) Rare poorly defined sharp waves over the left occipital region, seen on Days 3-4 Rare generalized rhythmic delta activity seen on Day 3 Bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic slowing, worse at first over the right at the start of the study, but more pronounced on the left by the end of the study Right hemisphere attenuation/suboptimal organization, which Â· improves over the course of the study 5. Mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction with suboptimal organization, which improves over the\\tcourse of the study FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are significant for foal seizures over the right posterior quadrant and epileptogenic activity over the left posterior quadrant. There is also bilateral posterior quadrant cerebral dysfunction and right hemisphere dysfunction, superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction . The posterior quadrant and diffuse dysfunction improve over the course of the study. The seizures resolve by Day 2.'"

      "text/plain": "' ï»¿History:\\t31 year old woman who had several seizures in 5/2014.  Large left frontal meningioma was subsequently found and patient underwent tumor resection.  She has occasional seizures since then. Medications:\\tTegretol Sedation: EEG Type:\\tRoutine, awake & drowsy Technique:\\tInternational 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by a few vertex waves.  Vertex waves are more pronounced over the left. Occasional polymorphic delta activity is noted over the left frontotemporal region.  Additional, moderate amplitude fast activity is present over the bilateral frontocentral regions (breach artifact), left>right.  A single left frontotemporal sharp transient is captured. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm. Summary of Findings: No stage 2 sleep Breach artifact, bilateral, frontocentral Beta, excessive Sharp transients, one, left frontotemporal Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, moderate, left frontotemporal Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 28 minute EEG due to occasional moderate left frontotemporal focal slowing.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  Breach artifact is secondary to the underlying skull defect.  The presence of a single left frontotemporal sharp transient waveform is of uncertain clinical significance.  It occurs in the same location as breach artifact and focal slowing. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.'"

The patient had a choking spell followed by left-sided numbness and then twitching with bilateral hand numbness.  No pulmonary complaints, but history of obesity. MEDICATIONS:  Acyclovir, lisinopril, Symbicort, and aspirin. INTRODUCTION:  A 28 minute and digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances, and less than 5 kilohms. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta the ETA.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.  In hyperventilation and, following hyperventilation and drowsiness, as the patient drifts off to sleep, there are prominent bursts of rhythmic frontal 3-4 Hz activity.  Some of these bursts have EKG artifact in them, giving the appearance of the spike and wave complex, but there are no bursts of frontal delta, which have definitive spike and wave morphology.  The patient is able to transition to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles and again these brief bursts of rhythmic frontal delta. Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving. Heart rate 84 bpm. IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for. Bursts of prominent frontal 3-4 Hz activity in drowsiness. At but remain represent a somewhat disrupted sleep pattern. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There was no definitive spike and wave activity.  The bursts of frontal delta are in a nonspecific pattern.  They may represent in a drowsy pattern in this adult.  If there were no focal features in this record and there were no focal epileptiform features.  If this individual is thought to have an underlying sleep disturbance, or disrupted sleep, the frontal delta and arousals might fit into that phenomenon.  If generalized seizures are a consideration, a follow up, 1 hour study may be of value.'"

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.  Wakefulness and sleep were captured. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a bilateral alpha rhythm which is about 9.5 Hz on the left hemisphere, but it is disrupted on the right hemisphere.  There is bifrontal slowing more pronounced on the right hemisphere.  The slowing is frequently sharply contoured.  Sleep was characterized by vertex waves and K complexes.  The right focal slowing was more pronounced during sleep. There were discreet sharps on the right hemisphere in the FP2 region and rarely in T2 region. Hyperventilation was performed which showed diffuse slowing of the record with increase in amplitude. Photic stimulation was performed which did not show any changes in the EEG record.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 45-year-old man who presents with right frontal intracranial hemorrhage and generalized tonic-clonic convulsion.  Past medical history is also notable for a stroke. CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra; 2 mg of Ativan given in the emergency room. CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9 Hz alpha activity that is unstable.  The anterior to posterior frequency gradient is weak.  Diffuse beta is observed.  Additional polymorphic diffuse theta and delta activity, as well as frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) are captured.  No normal sleep architecture is observed; however, periods of quiescence are noted.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, notably over the right lateral leads.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. FINDINGS: Mild to moderate diffuse slowing. FIRDA. Paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, especially over the right temporal region. IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing and right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right temporal region.  Diffuse slowing indicates neurologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal cerebral slowing is suggestive of underlying focal cerebral dysfunction.  Excess beta is secondary to medication effect such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines.  FIRDA could be seen in various encephalopathies, increased intracranial pressure, or deep white matter lesions.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does no preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.'"

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient received Ativan and a Depakote load and then an Ativan drip. Her last clinical seizure was noted at 3:00 p.m. on February 22, 2012. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As said record starts the patient is intubated.  She has a fair amount of muscle and intermittent grimacing.  It is more difficult to identify the pattern of generalized paroxysmal fast activity that was noted in her baseline EEG.  The overall pattern is a slow, featureless pattern of delta and theta. There are some sharply contoured activity in the right frontal temporal region.  Despite the muscle and artifact noted in the background, there are occasional triphasic waves observed. Over the course of the afternoon, the patient receives Ativan, particularly after 3:00 p.m.  By this point there is some restless, but not that same clear clinical seizure pattern.  The overall background is markedly slow.  There is a periodic complex noted in the right hemisphere, including central temporal region, and triphasic waves are observed.  The patient is placed on an Ativan drip.  No additional clinical seizures are noted.  The EEG remains very slow. As the night continues, there is more of a burst suppression pattern.  There is a featureless pattern with a burst suppression pattern and intermittent theta.  The previously described, periodic sharp waves noted primarily in the right disappear and the periods of suppression are quite prominent in the overnight recording and a little bit more subtle at the 11:00 a.m. recording. By the morning of February 23, 2012 tactile stimulation does not activate the record. HR:    120 bpm IMPRESSION:  This LTM EEG monitoring was remarkable for: An initial pattern which was technically challenging, but with a great deal of muscle and movement artifact. The disappearance of well defined generalized paroxysmal fast activity. Triphasic waves. Periodic sharp waves primarily in the right hemisphere. Ultimately a more of a diffusely slow and discontinuous pattern. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  The use of the benzodiazepine may play a role in the background slowing, but given the comorbidities of this patient's medical issues, a more severe systemic or cerebral process must also be considered.\""

Past medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, hypertension, and diabetes. MEDICATIONS:  Nimodipine, Gentamicin, Dilantin, Keppra. REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while comatose.  No activating procedures were performed, other than stimulation. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  When the patient is stimulated during the recording, there is no clear change in the wave forms. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves seen at F4, continuously at a frequency of 0.5 to 1 Hz, representing periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).  It is apparent that with each of these discharges, although not always consistently, there seems to be clinical correlates in the middle of left shoulder twitching. Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts. SEIZURES:  Based on the description above, it is likely that the accompaniment of the PLEDs at F4 with the left shoulder twitching is consistent with focal motor seizures. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Right frontal PLEDs and focal motor seizures. Generalized slow waves with intermittent periods of attenuation. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals focal motor seizures arising from the right frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology but may be partly due to medication effect or cortical injury from the subarachnoid hemorrhage.'"

      "text/plain": "\" INTRODUCTION: Long-term video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There are no clinical seizures noted by the team.  There are test push button events. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The background EEG demonstrates some portions of  the record with prolonged focal slowing from the left temporal region with sharp waves and spikes.   In sleep, there is frontal delta and occasional vertex waves.  The overall background is slow from both hemispheres, particularly from the left temporal region.   Review of the Stellate detections identifies primarily left temporal, irregular, high amplitude focal slowing and sharp waves. Rare spikes from the right hemisphere are seen. Subclinical seizures are seen at 12:13 and 12:54. The patient is asleep, lying on one side.  Trains of high amplitude, left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity are identified. The onset is relatively clear at 12:54, but the off set is a bit more complicated although it is clearly over by 12:59 AM. A similar discharge is noted at 00:16:44. Stage II sleep is characterized by spindles and can be seen at 4:24 AM.  The focal epileptiform activity is again seen at this time. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 1, 2006 to March 2, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Topiramate, Valproate, and others. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system  of  electrode  placement  with one channel  of EKG. Practice  push buttons were recorded, but no clinical seizures were observed by the patient or caregivers. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The seizure file demonstrates intermittent, prolonged bursts of spike and slow wave and focal slowing from the left.  In some cases, these are on the order of minutes, but there is no clear postictal slowing or off set, although there are also portions where this activity has disappeared. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP:  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.  The waking record at times demonstrates rhythmic background slowing with primarily a theta frequency pattern and at other times there are left temporal sharp waves or spikes. Philadelphia, PA 19140 Long-Term EEG Monitoring, 111arch 2, 2006 to March 3,  2006 SEIZURE TIME- 16:08: The patient is in bed, lying on his left side. He had some occasional automatisms.  In contrast to previous sections of the record, there seems to be an initially 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified.  There is a fair amount of background muscle artifact and the EEG is best reviewed with both a 60Hz and 35Hz filter. It is noted that at 16:05, the patient seems to be awake, but he is in his usual state of delta. He  has some spontaneous movements, which would suggest that the presence of the 8 to 9 Hz  alpha frequency activity is actually pathologic in this patient.  Because the first changes actually resemble normal cerebral activity, it is a bit difficult to be entirely certain where the seizure begins. At 16:06, the background slowing is noted  from the right, but the left seems to be a bit more attenuated.\\tAt 16:07, there are rhythmic, repetitive sharp waves from the left.  This is a more prolonged discharge and has some evidence for frequency evolution. The alpha frequency activity appears at 16:07:47.  During this time, there are no clear clinical correlates for this event. However,  at  16:08:17, the activity that looks like normal alpha activity is likely pathologic in this individual.  At 16:08:28, the right and movements are  identified. \\tThey  are  initially  non-specific,  but then are somewhat  repetitive. They do produce some artifact, surprisingly more so than one would expect.   The repetitive circular movements continue.   They are at times almost slow and intermittent  and at 16:08:46, there is a background of alpha frequency activity bilaterally with rhythmic 3 to 5 Hz  activity picked up in the T1-T2 electrodes. The activity seems to be slowing with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity, particularly in the temporal regions, with some field of spread to the right at 16:08:54.  The patient remains lying on his left side, paying attention to the left, with sporadic jerking  in the minutes that follow.   The background at 16:10 may be slower than previously identified.  Additional high amplitude left anterior temporal spikes are seen at 16:10, which is a non-sustained burst.  An individual enters and leaves the room at 16:13.  The individual can't be heard on camera and seems to be just off camera.  Patient is noted to be somewhat tremulous and that individual's  observation may be what led to the nurse entering the room at 16:19 and pushing the button.  Patient appears confused in this section of the record, with the caregiver holding his hand. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS  AND SLEEP:  Much of the drowsy record is a pattern of theta with small amounts of beta.  The trains of sharp waves and spikes seen from the left were not seen at those other times. CLINICAL NOTE: The precise description of the behavior described in the nurse's note is not possible to define. In the sleep recording, there were occasional sharp waves noted from the right with some independent right and left temporal sharp waves.  The alpha frequency activity picked up in the clinical seizure seen at 16:07 was not seen at any other time and differed substantially from  other  portions  of  the  record,  some  of  which  do  demonstrate  sustained  left  temporal discharges.  There are occasional left temporal sharp waves, but the majority are from the right. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 3, 2006 to 111arch 4, 2006 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates prominent portions of  the record with rhythmic continuous theta and sharply contoured slowing, as well as sharp waves from the left temporal region.  These include 14:37 when the patient gets up to go to the bathroom. At that time, there does seem to be some frequency evolution, the patient is with the nurse who notes no clinical change.  While the patient is off camera in the bathroom, the EEG activity does seem to accelerate and afterwards the rhythmic slowing and sharp waves are less prominent.  Single channel artifact is then picked up at 14:46. Push buttons for this 24-hour section are reviewed and no seizures are seen in association with the push buttons. The overnight recording for the patient is remarkable for sequential loss of electrodes and great amounts of artifact. Reviewing the seizure detection file, no additional seizures are identified. Long-Term BEG Monitoring, March 4, 2006 to March 5, 2006 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient has multiple push buttons when he is in need of  things.  These include 9:27 AM, 11:00, 11:02, and 13:35.  This section of the record includes many Stellate detections, all of which are artifact.  There are portions of the record with rhythmic mixed theta and delta. SEIZURE TIME 10:28:45: The patient is in bed on the morning of the 5th. He was previously asleep in stage II  sleep  with vertex wave, K complexes, and spindles.   In the time samples previous to this including 10:24, there are trains of spike and slow wave and sharp waves seen from the left temporal region.  There are rare sharp waves identified from the right.  Immediately prior to the discharge, there is some focal slowing and sharp waves, but not as persistent in nature as seen in other epochs of the record.  The first ictal change is seen at 10:28:45 with a burst of low voltage alpha/beta frequency activity.  This is in the left mid-to-posterior temporal regions, spreading to the posterior temporal region at 10:28:55 and then to the anterior temporal region ten seconds later.  The patient is lying on his side, under the sheets.  It is difficult to know which hand starts to tremble, but once the head starts to move at 10:29:25, it is clear that it is the right hand 20 seconds later.  The right hand extends and there are circular movements.  The right hand and then right leg demonstrate tonic and then tonic-clonic activity at 10:29:55. More generalized tonic-clonic activity is seen ten seconds later.  By 10:32:25, the ictal activity starts to slow with rhythmic paroxysmal slowing. The seizure demonstrates a clear paroxysmal pattern with slowing and a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.   The precise ending of the seizure is partly obscured  by muscle and movement artifact, but it seems to be over by 10:33:35.  The patient has a prolonged and profound postictal  period with  background  slowing.   The  video  indicates  a prolonged period where he is trying to sit up. He  seems to be having difficulty using his right side and he falls backwards in bed. He starts sliding out of bed at 10:39:05 and at 10:40:06 falls on the floor.  Shortly after this, the clinical team enters and notes that the patient is confused and cannot answer questions lucidly.  As the patient recovers, he is lying in bed and again the left temporal sharp and slow wave activity is identified.  The total seizure duration for this individual is approximately four minutes with a relatively prolonged onset prior to the first ictal change, with clear scalp localization in the temporal regions. SEIZURE TIME 18:10: The patient is sitting in a chair at 18:12:33. The nurse enters and hands the patient something. He takes medicine and swallows at 18:12:41. At 18:12:48, he has a cup of water and medicine in his hand.  The nurse is at the bedside.  At 18:12:54, there is a clear change in frequency of the background with this rhythmic, faster alpha frequency activity.  The patient is sitting. The nurse is partially obscuring the patient  He seems to have some automatic behaviors on the right and the left.  The nurse can determine that something is wrong at 18:13:02 when he has an abrupt motor movement   Unfortunately, the nurse reaches across to help the patient and obscures the camera view of the patient   The nurse on the camera indicates that there is rapid, clonic activity at 18:13:11.  The video indicates that this is on the right   The patient seems to have partial impairment of awareness at 18:13:30 and 40, seemingly trying to help the nurse, but then by 18:13:45, this is much more generalized with vocalization.  The clinical team completely obscures the patient, but behind them he seems to be having a tonic-clonic seizure.  This seems to be asymmetric with much more significant tonic-clonic activity on the right compared to the left. The activity demonstrates frequency evolution, starting to slow at 18:14:25.  The patient remains slumped to the left side  at  18:14:36.   The precise  end of this seizure is a  little  difficult  to determine.   It is abating by 18:15:24 and is clearly over by 18:15:33.  Total seizure duration is three minutes.  Postictally, there is a fair amount of slowing in the background.  The EKG lead is obscured. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: There is a fair amount of movement artifact when the patient is up and out of bed.  The overall background when he is awake is slow on the right, and intermittently from the left hemisphere there are bursts and trains of left temporal focal slowing and spikes, most of which are in the mid-to-anterior temporal region.   There are also occasional  spike and slow wave complexes noted  from the right, particularly in the posterior temporal region.  This section of the overnight recording is remarkable for a fair amount of wakefulness captured late at night   On one or two occasions, he does seem to have an alpha rhythm on the right   The EKG lead is uninterpretable.  Notable in this section of the record are frequent  left  temporal  spikes.   Review of this section of the record, using the Stellate seizure detection software, identifies no additional clinical seizures with a burst of fast activity from the left temporal region.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software as well as patient's noted and nurse's noted events were used to review the EEG. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 5 Hz which is not reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  There are at times appears to be stage changes and appears to go into sleep, but the normal sleep architecture is not usually seen. ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal sharp waves seen at F8/T4 and independently at F7/T3, a little bit more frequently on the left. Focal slowing is seen at F8/T4 and at F7/T3 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts. There is focal slowing also seen at C3/CZ continuously at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts. SEIZURES:  During the recording and especially particularly in the first 2 hours, there were multiple seizures about 10 noted originating with a rhythmic theta discharge seen at F7/T3 increasing in frequency and decreasing in amplitude at times ping-ponging to the right anterior temporal region and sometimes remaining in the same region, lasting for 30-45 seconds.  During these episodes, the patient appears to have right arm stiffening and mouth movements as well as staring unresponsively.  After the first 2 hours of the recording, there were only 2 seizures seen in the rest of the recording for about 15 hours. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Multiple seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region. Bi-temporal sharp waves. Background slowing and left central focal slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of multiple seizures arising from the left temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability arising from both anterior temporal lobes which has a high correlation for seizures arising from either region.  Lastly, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left central region which is consistent with the known tumor resection.  In addition to all this, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.\""

Nursing- initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.  The Gotman spike and seizure detection algorithm (Stellate) was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges. # Push button events Description of pushbutton events Description: There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Early in the recording the background consists of a mixture of diffuse low amplitude delta activity admixed with periodic frontally predominant diffuse stereotyped theta activity.  This activity likely represents ventilator artifact.  Once EEG leads are fixed at ~ 9 am, the background changes to very low amplitude diffuse polymorphic delta activity with underriding fast activity.  Fast activity tends to occur in 3-4 second bursts with 3-4 seconds of interburst interval. There are frequent 30-50 second focal seizures that are seen starting at ~ 9 am.  Their frequency gradually decreases with last electrographic seizure captured at ~12:22 PM.  Seizures are characterized by rhythmic 3 Hz activity observed over right frontal  region (maximal over F4 electrode).  This activity increases in frequency to ~ 4-5 Hz and stops abruptly.  There is no clear spatial evolution and no clinical correlate.  No normal sleep architecture is present. There is no clear reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.

Summary of Findings: Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe Attenuation, moderate Status epilepticus, right frontal, over F4, 30-50 sec sz Secondary bilateral synchrony, right frontal, last seizure at ~ 12:22 pm No reactivity Interpretation: This is a very ABNORMAL 24-hour continuous video EEG due to (1) severe diffuse slowing; (2) lack of clear background reactivity and (3) focal right frontal status epilepticus seen early in the recording. Diffuse slowing and lack of reactivity are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lamictal: Phenobarbital, Zonisamide INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has difficulty keeping the EEG electrodes on. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Random wakefulness and sleep: In wakefulness some sections of the record are well organized, others demonstrate excess background theta, particularly in the central regions bilaterally. Particularly, in sleep there are interictal epileptiform activity, including right mid to posterior temporal, left mid to anterior temporal, and some appear to be a bilateral high amplitude poly spike component. There is generous stage 2 sleep. There are multiple push button events including practice push button 16:10, 18:55, 19:50. Seizure: The patient is playing with the push button alarm at 07:51. She seems to be awake, but there is a great deal of muscle movement artifact. Physician enters at 07:52 the patient is confused and looking to the left. This seizure is difficult to localize because the onset is unclear, but there seems to be rhythmic theta frequency activity, perhaps most intense at T2, but in the right frontal central region. This activity is relatively prolonged, but by 07:52:24 she gets up and out of bed, and in fact she gets up and out of bed just as soon as the physician leaves, although she was not interactive with the physician during the seizure. Unfortunately there are significant problems with electrode caliber during the event. After this she is awake, but the background demonstrates excess theta as noted at other portions in the record. This is January 14 to January 15, 2010. January 15 2010 through January 16 2010: Random wakefulness at this time sample begins shortly after the seizure early in the morning on January 15, 2010. Seizure Time: 08:19 with the patient in bed and drifting off to sleep there seems to be a seizure in sleep with rhythmic repetitive sharp waves in the left hemisphere with a generous field of spreading, including frontal central, central temporal, T1 at 7, and involving C3. There are no clinical correlates observed with this seizure. In this portion of the record, interictal spikes and sharp waves are more prominent on the left. After this the patient drifts off asleep and there is some bitemporal sharp waves observed. In addition, there seemed to be some frontal central sharp waves noted. Seizure Time 10:01: The patient pushes the button while she is eating. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the tech has just wrapped her head there is significant artifact in the background. The patient stops eating and she rests her head backwards. She extends her head as if she is waiting for the seizure to happen. Despite the artifacts observed in the EEG, definitive EEG changes are noted at 01 :02, approximately 1 minute into the seizure. Epileptiform activity this time seems to be most prominent in the right frontal central region and it also seems to be more sustained at right frontal central region and right anterior temporal region. During the initial ictal changes she is sitting, staring a bit to the left, neck extended. The frequency of activity starts to slow. The nurse enters at 01:02:42 and the patient gestures to the nurse, looks at the nurse, she puts her head down at 01 :02:50 and she seems to be eating. The seizure seems to be over or ending at 01:02:59, and then the patient is getting out of bed at 01:04:29, but she seems to be confused and the nurses are trying to get her back into bed. The remainder of the seizure detections were artifact. In particular in sleep sharp waves were noted, including right mid to anterior temporal region, T1 with some polyspike and slow wave activity, T6. Of note, epileptiform activity was not as quite prominent and at times there is a T6 train of smaller triangular shaped waves. HR: 100 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG monitoring due to: 1. Three complex partial seizures, not all of which were adequately localized by scalp EEG. One of them was very poorly localized, the second in wakefulness seems to come from the right hemisphere, and third in sleep out of the left. 2. Interictal epileptiform activity from either hemisphere, but most prominently right posterior temporal, although left anterior temporal, T3, and bifrontal regions were noted. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic brain with multiple areas, temporal and extra temporal, which produce interictal epileptiform discharges. The patient seemed to have a prolonged aura for the seizures, which occurred in wakefulness, suggesting that additional intervention and evaluation when she is not pregnant might be useful.'"

MEDICATIONS: \\tDilantin, Depakote, phenobarbital, insulin, digoxin, Lopressor. INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. During the record, including on the 26th, the Phenobarbital was turned off. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial data on the 24th there are intermittent seizures occurring in the contexts of burst suppression. There are prolonged periods of suppression with brief seizures. However, by 16:28 the EEG is completely suppressed. This section of the record was previously dictated. Additional recording after 16:37 for the following subsequent days includes the following: October 24 to October 25: A suppressed EEG. The patient can be visualized in the unit. Technologist and nurses work with her. The background EEG remains markedly suppressed. October 25 to October 26: Again no definite cerebral activity is observed. The overall activity is very low voltage. Electrode artifacts and other artifacts are observed. There is no variability in the record, although there is some EKG artifact. October 26 to October 27: Background EEG continues to demonstrate an essentially suppressed pattern. There is some artifact picked up in the background. With the use of alternative montages the overall activity appears to be essentially artifactual. CLINICAL HISTORY: This is an 82-year-old female with a history of a right frontal craniotomy for tumor, now in status. MEDICATIONS:  Multiple anesthetic medication, including Propofol, Dilantin INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG performed using standard 10-20 Hz electrode placement with l channel EKG. Study from 2253 on October 23, 2008 through October 24, 2008 at 1043. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Due to continuous right frontal sharp waves patient is put higher in a pentobarbital coma. There seems to be more bursts of right frontal sharp waves consistent with the status, but there are some seen as well on the left. Pentobarbital is started at 125. At that time an intermittent suppression pattern is seen. Periods of bursts will go from 30 seconds to 1 minute and 40 seconds. When there is a return of the burst the patient is seen to reenter a status pattern of right frontal greater than left sharp waves, which can last for 20 seconds before there is return of suppression. As the records continues you have longer periods of suppression, but as soon as the patient returns to a burst pattern, again you see the nonconvulsive status pattern of the right predominantly frontal discharges. On the right there is definitely extension of these discharges throughout the hemisphere. A heart rate 60 beats per minute. IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 1.\\tPharmacological burst suppression pattern. 2. Bursts of continuous sharp waves seen, right greater than left. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record is consistent with continuous status throughout the pharmacological burst suppression pattern.'"

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Propofol INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The background includes a pattern of low voltage or mixed frequency theta and delta. There is frontal, sharply contoured activity with 2 different morphologies in the right and left frontal region. There is a bit more faster frontal activity on the left than the right. As the recording continues , the left frontal periodic complex emerges maximum P1, F3. In addition, as this emerges, over the first 20 seconds that it is seen, rhythmic theta frequency activity begins to develop in this background. There is a mixture of theta alpha and then sharp waves with some evolution of the sharp waves. The first sign of an ictal pattern is seen at 13:04:13. By 13:07:11 a more definitive ictal discharge appears again, left frontal maximum. At 13:08: 15, the tech raises the question as to whether or not these are clinical seizures. Ongoing ictal activity which waxes and wanes and includes some alpha frequency activity can be observed in the left frontal central region. There is some spread to the right frontal region, but the majority of the activity is in the left. The use of frontal and parasagittal montage clearly delineates the left frontal epileptiform activity which waxes and wanes and seems to have frequency evolution with alpha and beta frequency activity. There are no clinical correlates documented for the patient's seizures. HR:\\t104 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1.  Status epilepticus. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of an ongoing ictal pattern. Clinical team was notified at the time of the recording.\""

INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. During this recording, the patient has seizures at 1616, 1834, 01 :24:11, and 05:14:52. DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal with excess beta and theta. It is difficult to find a well-defined alpha rhythm. Prominent rhythmic theta is noted in the right temporal or occipital region and there are sharp waves noted. Sleep is characterized by an increase in beta with spindles and arrhythmic delta activity. Sharp waves on this EEG can be posterior, right occipital, anterior temporal or even on one or two occasions right frontal. Epileptiform activity is accentuated in sleep and some of it has a bifrontal or more generalized appearance. There are clear stage 2 sleep morphologies. Stage 2 sleep also is associated with some generalized, bifrontal spike and slow wave or polyspike complexes. Seizure number one 16:16:26. The patient is with his mother. He is asleep. In sleep, there is repetitive spiking noted from the right mid to posterior temporal region. The patient starts to stir from sleep at 16:14:50 and he looks at his mother, which produces an increase in muscle in the background. He looks about for several seconds and he speaks to his mother, although it is difficult to tell what he said. He gestures with his left hand, puts the left hand to the mouth and looks about. Behaviorally, this seems to be an aura because he does not seem to be having any clinical symptoms and then his mother goes to get the urinal. No clinical manifestations are noted aside from tremulousness and an urge to go to the bathroom. However, as the patient gets up to go to the bathroom, he starts to have jerking at 16:16:30 with jerking, vocalizations and tremulousness. He holds the left hand a bit more still and jerks the right hand He also has characteristic ictal-type respirations. The primary features of this seizure include restlessness. By 17:36, he is able to answer questions. Behaviorally, the seizure is primarily characterized by abnormal respirations and agitation. Seizure time 18:34:54. The patient has been resting in bed. He is dozing. Again, he sits up abruptly, moves about, breathes rapidly and is briefly agitated. This seizure ends at 18:35:36 and he has automatisms and gestures, is confused and tries to take off the electrodes at 18:35:47. By EEG, this is a somewhat challenging EEG to localize because of the high amplitude activity and the muscle artifact. The epileptiform activity prior to this seizure is right posterior temporal and, during the seizure, very difficult to localize in part because of the muscle artifact. There is a clear postictal change. Seizure time 23:44 is just a push button event. Seizure time 01:23:40. The patient has been asleep with a focal slowing in sharp waves seen in the right occipital and posterior region. Muscle artifact is seen at 01 :23:49. He sits up, has the characteristic respirations, is a bit agitated and tremulous. He starts to take off the blood pressure cuff and the covers. He has midline, fearful movements as were seen in the previous seizure.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a medium amplitude background. The overall waking record is relatively well-organized particularly in the morning of 9/14/2010. The record continues to demonstrate right occipital sharp waves and spike waves, occasional bifrontal sharp waves and fewer right anterior temporal sharp waves and fewer right anterior temporal sharp waves. Trains of sharp waves are noted at 8:16 in the morning on 9/14/2010, but are asymptomatic and the patient is conversant. HR: 80 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING 09/15/2010 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: On the 15th, he has frequent, right anterior temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes. He also has some frontal sharp and slow wave complexes which are bilateral and more remarkable on the left. There are sections of the record including where he has trains of right occipital sharp waves. Seizure Time: 09:32. The patient is in bed. At 09:32:30, he has repetitive spiking from the occipital regions most prominent in the 02 distribution. The spiking is essentially at 5 hertz. At 9:32:38, he has stiffening which his mother is instantly aware of and reaches for the push button. Behavioral aspects of the seizures include lack of movement on the left and tremulousness on the right with coarse respirations. This clinical seizure progresses at 9:33 to tonic clonic activity with focalization just prior to this. The EEG pattern is a tonic clonic pattern and the jerking is slightly asynchronous right shoulder more so than the left. This is a very difficult seizure to localize because of activity and the activity is clearly bilateral by 09:33:18, but it looks like early in his seizure, it may transition from occipital to anterior temporal. The physician comes in at 09:34. By that point, the EEG is transitioning to postictal state. The patient remains tremulous at the end of the seizure. There is some rhythmic activity picked up on the left parasagittal region including the left occipital, but the activity seems to have abated on the right and the right has transitioned to a more of a slow pattern.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is having a seizure just as the EEG is hooked up. The seizure is characterized by chewing movements. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the EEG shows periodic sharp waves are noted in the background with frontal delta and a periodic complex that seems to be emanating from the right hemisphere particularly the posterior region. There is also notched frontal delta. The activity is present in the initial section of the record lasting about 60 seconds and then terminates abruptly. As it terminates, the background demonstrates a low voltage suppressed pattern. Within minutes, a second seizure begins which is poorly localized, but may start with left mid to posterior temporal sharp wave followed by suppression and then replacement of the preexisting background with sharply contoured theta. This is present bilaterally, but there does seem to be a phase reversal on the left temporal electrodes. This also ends abruptly and seems to end with stimulation. Interestingly, this 15 second discharge ends on the right before the left. The discharges reappear lasting less than a minute and then are followed by background suppression. As the recording continues, additional electrographic seizures are noted which are clearly maximum in the left hemisphere with repetitive sharp activity T3. Most seizures are less than a minute in duration. Typical characteristics are chewing and movement of the head. HR: 120 bpm and irregular IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1.

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old woman status post recent cardiac stent placement with progressive encephalopathy and asterixis. Seizures this am, now intubated with right arm twitching. MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Phenobarbital INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The recording begins at 9 a.m. after the patient has had 8 mg Ativan. She is intubated and demonstrates intermittent rhythmic movement of the right hand only. This was a 20 minute baseline and 5 hour EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although there Is a fair amount of muscle and motion artifact in the EEG, when the muscle artifact drops out, a lower voltage pattern of a mixture of theta and delta activity can be identified. There is almost a bit of discontinuity with 2 Hz delta activity and scant amount of 6 Hz theta activity. Superimposed upon this is a periodic complex from the right hemisphere maximum in the right frontotemporal and frontocentral regions with an F2 sharp wave.   Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact. Some sections of the record with more muscle artifact are associated with eye movement and unfortunately in these sections of the record, it is difficult to really define the underlying EEG pattern due to the muscle artifact.  As the recording continues, the epileptiform activity can be identified particularly using an average reference and it is maximum more at F5 than at FT2. Again, each time that the patient has eye movement, it is more challenging to see the EEG, but the eye movements are relatively slower.  Phenobarbital is initialed at 10:54 for a total of500 mg. This actually produces an increase in overall theta frequency in the record and more of a transition to a more of a rhythmic theta pattern. There are some sharp waves picked up in the left frontal region at 11:58. There is a subtle intermittent discontinuity noted particularly at 2 p.m. The sharp waves are improved despite some muscle artifact as the recording continues. It is not possible to determine if the patient has been twitching later on in the record. Her hand is covered up. By 3:14 when the record stops and she seems to have a little bit more muscle artifact, the sharp waves can be identified but they are not occurring in bursts. The EEG concludes at 3:18. IMPRESSION: This is a challenging but markedly abnormal EEG due to: 1. An initial clinical appearance of seizure characterized by movements of the right hand and repetitive sharp waves in the right. 2. Marked background slowing. 3. Very slow pattern seen initially with an improvement to more of a theta frequency pattern following the use of the phenobarbital. 4. Rare frontal sharp waves on the left. CLINICAL CORRELATION: Overall, by the end of this section of this EEG, there is an improvement in the overall background, which is particularly important given the significant focal features noted initially.'"

Intermittent high amplitude left temporal sharp waves are observed. MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Neurontin, INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard system of electrodes with 1 channel of EKG.: As the seizure begins, there is rhythmic delta activity with frequency evolution in the left anterior temporal region with the appearance of spike activity, rhythmic repetitive spikes or sharps at 04720. The patient has been asleep during the seizure and she starts to arouse relatively late in the seizure. At 0437 40 there is a car alarm and then 10 seconds later behaviorally she seems to be waking up looking to the right. A nurse enters late in the seizure at 0449 and notes that the patient is confused and unable to speak. The total seizure duration is 2 minutes in duration. Testing is performed in the post ictal section. The patient can answer with only automatic speech such as oh, oh, oh, and that's it or I don't know. She is not able to give her name until 04:51:24 appropriately a minute and a half after her seizure and she is actually still quite impaired. At 04:53:24 the nurse concludes her assessment and the patient drifts off to sleep. In the post ictal section of the record there is prominent dropout of faster frequency activity and as the patient drifts off the sleep in the early morning hours, there is again  prominent disruption of faster frequency activity although the right hemisphere suggests that she is just a little drowsy and the alpha rhythm comes and goes. Behaviorally, the patient appears to be asleep. The E..G lead was lost at the close of the seizure. This is a complex partial seizure, with good localization to the left anterior temporal region. Long-term monitoring 07/29 to 07/30. During this section of the record, the patient was not aware of any seizures.   The EEG monitoring demonstrates good quality recording for wakefulness only. Unfortunately, due to electrode problems, there is no good quality sleep noted and no additional epileptiform abnormalities were identified in the second section of the record. LONG TERM MONITORING-07/31/2010 INTRODUCTION: During this section of the record, the patient reports no seizures. None are reported by the clinical team. The seizure and spike detector was reviewed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-organized 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm. In sleep, there are occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves. Sleep is relatively disrupted. Deeper stages of sleep are identified including stage II and even the beginning of stage III. No seizures can be identified. The spike detector was reviewed and the time sample which included 4 to 5 a.m. was reviewed in search of additional seizures. HR: 60pm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. High amplitude left anterior temporal spike. 2. Sharps in sleep and drowsiness. CLINICAL CORRELATION: One left temporal/complex partial seizure was identified. The vast majority of epileptiform activity was left. There was a section at 3:34 which may represent alpha delta sleep with frontal delta but no definitive seizure.\""

It must be noted, however, that when the technologist tells the patient to close his eyes he does not do it and he continues to move around and blink. For the 11:29 event, the patient knocks off one of his EEG electrodes and then lies back. The technologist does not seem to have observed that change. The EEG during the second event was just a bit more prolonged. It was primarily remarkable for higher amplitude 3-4 hertz activity from the right hemisphere with some bifrontal representation.

As the EEG starts, the patient has just had a seizure.  The patient has an additional seizure during the EEG while the study is recording. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, the EEG includes a fair amount of muscle.  Despite this, there is a breach rhythm from the left frontal region with generous beta activity as well as rhythmic theta.  The activity from the right hemisphere is lower voltage with generous fast activity.  The second seizure in this EEG is preceded by several minutes of rhythmic theta frequency activity from the left frontal region including F7, F3, and C3. There are occasional F7 or F3 sharp waves.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Fentanyl, Phenobarbital, antibiotics. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This recording is performed for a child with a chronic static encephalopathy who is responsive in an attempt to make sure that no subclinical seizures occur as medications are tapered.  This is a 6.5 hour EEG. There is no seizure log. In the EEG itself, there are no push button events, and the computer does not identify electrographic seizures. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG is remarkable for a moderate degree of artifact.  While the child has been described as responsive, he seems to be sleeping throughout much of the EEG with occipitally predominant delta.  The overall background is rich in delta and beta.  The awake recording for this child is remarkable for an extraordinary amount of background beta particularly in the frontal regions.  As the recording continues, the child is increasingly active.  At times, there is what is likely artifact identified as a single-channel phenomena in the T1-T2 channel, which is alpha frequency in nature.  What may well be the sleep record is characterized by posterior delta and frontal beta.  Compatible with the reduction of anesthetic medications, as the recording continues, the child is more active.  There are portions of the record with focal beta activity, which is asymmetric, seen much more prominent in the right frontal regions than the left, although the beta is extraordinary in both hemispheres. HR:  116 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Replacement of normal background for a child of this age with a pattern of prominent occipital delta and generous frontal fast activity. An intermittent asymmetry with more remarkable fast activity from the right frontal region. CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were identified in this record.  In contrast to a previous section of the record, the frontal sharp waves were not identified and this child did not appear to have jerking of the shoulders as previously noted.'"

History of right parietal contusion admitted to the Trauma Service one year ago. MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Midazolam, Dilantin, ASA, Pantoprazole INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very low voltage, slow featureless pattern. When reviewed at lower sensitivities, low voltage beta is noted. There is an asymmetry in the delta and there is more delta in the right posterior quadrant. Twenty-four hours of EEG recording is provided. There is little clinical information documented in the record. As the recording begins, it is primarily a low voltage beta pattern. The focal delta is noted as well as some sharply contoured delta at T 4. Over time, there is an increase in frontal beta activity and intermittent arousal. By the afternoon, the patient's electrodes are sometimes a bit challenged but then are repaired by the technologist. Overall, over the course of the record, there is an overall improvement. In this intubated, comatose patient, what is likely an electrographic seizure is noted at 4:52:32 p.m. Although there is some electrode artifact, there does seem to be some frequency evolution. Following the seizure, the patient is more alert. He is noted to be moving about. As the recording continues into the end of the 24-hour epoch, there are intermittent problems with the electrodes. Review of the automated seizure and spike detection software does not identify other electrographic seizures. HR: 120 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to: 1. Initially a markedly suppressed pattern. 2. A single subcritical seizure observed at 4:35:22 p.m. on the afternoon of the 9th. 3. Occasional sharply contoured right anterior temporal delta. Right posterior temporal delta. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. Additional evaluation may be obtained as warranted. Day 2, March 9-March 10, 2011 Demonstration of this section of the record includes a very low voltage suppressed pattern. Identical, left posterior quadrant delta was noted. Artifact is noted in the T2 electrode. As the recording continues, the patient remains intubated and unresponsive. The tech provides a medication update: Keppra, Dilantin, midazolam, aspirin. There is a section of the record at 3:30a.m. with an increase in theta in the right frontotemporal region. At the end of the available EEG, the overall EEG is low voltage , relatively featureless and slow. OVERALL IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION: This 2-day video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for: 1. The findings described in the initial section. A single seizure in a 2-day recording. 2. 3.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Bactrim INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient received 2 mg of Ativan during the EEG. There is very little testing of the patient during the EEG, but he is laying with eyes open, motionless in the bed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a lower voltage, slow pattern with delta and theta. The most prominent features in this record are high amplitude sharp wave spike or polyspike maximum in the right posterior quadrant with some variability, sometimes P4 or 02 maximum, sometimes T6. In addition, recurrent seizures are characterized by rhythmic repetitive theta frequency activity and repetitive spike activity with frequency evolution. The seizures terminate abruptly. Seizure duration is 1 minute 40 seconds to 40 seconds in duration. As the recording continues, the seizures start to merge into a less discreet pattern. HR: 109 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Status epilepticus with a pattern maximum in the right posterior temporal region. LONG TERM MONITORING 11/24-2812010 EEG LTM 10-135 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage slow pattern on the left. The right hemisphere has bursts of polyspike activity from the right central and parietal region. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. In the initial section of the record at 4:06, the bursts continue to build up, wax and wane. By 5:01 p.m., interestingly, the EEG is more continuous and the bursts are disappearing. By 6:41, the EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern. Despite the use of a Versed drip over the course of the night, intermittent rhythmic seizures are observed typically in the right central parietal region. The EEG also varies a bit in terms of a burst suppression pattern or a more continuous pattern but the seizures do occur out of the burst suppression pattern. The Versed is titrated up to a dose of 7 mg. By 4 a.m., the seizures are not sustained. AI 7:56 a.m., the EEG is increasingly continuous. The well defined seizures are not identified but bursts of activity are identified out of the right. There is a fair amount of variability in the background ranging from a more continuous pattern to a burst suppression pattern and then this ongoing highly epileptogenic pattern from the right hemisphere. From 11/25/2010 to 11/26/2010: The patient remains on a Versed drip. The video is not available. The overall background includes a relatively suppressed or intermittent burst suppression pattern. The well-defined seizures noted originally were not noted in this epoch of the record. At the end of this section of the record, bursts of activity up to 7 seconds with epileptiform activity in the right central and parietal regions are noted but the epileptiform activity is not as high amplitude as previously. Later sections on 11/25/2010, demonstrate a more continuous pattern with right occipital and parietal occipital spiking and polyspike activity. The record is quite variable with some sections clearly showing the same burst suppression pattern seen previously. No clinical seizures are noted and the seizure and spike detection identifies the burst suppression with parietal or posterior spikes but no sustained seizures.   On 11/26/2010 to 11/27/2010: This section of the record demonstrates a pattern that is not always burst suppression. There are bursts of activity always with a spike in the right posterior region. There are no sustained or clinical or electrographic seizures, although when there are bursts of activity that are longer than 3 seconds in duration, it appears as If the patient is likely to seize. The seizure and spike detector captures the majority of the epileptiform activity. By 8:29 on 11/27/2010, the epileptiform activity is no longer occurring in bursts and it has transitioned to more of a periodic pattern. On 11/27/2010 to 11/28/2010: This section of the record demonstrates frequent occipital or occipital parietal spikes. The background ranges from a burst suppression pattern to more of a continuous low voltage theta pattern. On some occasions, the bursts of sharp waves appear in brief trains.   HR: 120 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to: 1. Electrographic seizures noted in the first 24 hours of the record from the central parietal and posterior temporal regions. 2. Burst suppression pattern. 3. Bursts of epileptiform activity in the right posterior quadrant. 4. Some periodic sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the right posterior quadrant. Although no additional seizures were recorded, if the patient is still receiving a Versed or sedative hypnotic drip, that might explain the discontinuous pattern. If this patient is no longer receiving anesthetic levels of sedation, additional evaluation for global cerebral function is suggested.'"

LONG TERM MONITORING 11/21 + 22/2010 - 10-134 INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is frequently agitated. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. Some sections of the record demonstrate more significant sharp waves and polyspike activity in the right anterior temporal region than others. In contrast to the first 24 hours of EEG recording, the sharp activity is not as periodic. It does have more of a polyphasic component. It remains high amplitude. In this section of the record, the right hemisphere is slower than it was during some sections of this study performed on 11/20/2010 through 11/21/2010. Over the course of the data provided, the EEG electrodes are sometimes lost but overall although the overall background is transitioning more to a theta pattern and there are sharp waves, there is less of the sharp waves that are building up and evolving. There is no mention as to medications that were administered at 11 a.m. on 11/22/2010, but the overall background is consistently slower. HR: 78 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING 11/23 + 24/2010 - 10-134 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much more of this record demonstrates an alpha and theta frequency pattern. The patient is also a bit more active and is sometimes able to speak. Throughout much of the record there is less in the way of epileptiform activity than previously noted. There is one section of the record at 3:50 and another at 4:04. Because of the artifacts involved it is difficult to determine if there is in fact an epileptiform seizure at that time. Review of the video is quite challenging in terms of the amount of artifact. No clinical signs or symptoms are noted and in fact with the discharge at 3:50 p.m., the patient seemed to be well. HR: 90 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING 11/25 + 27/2010 - 10-134 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record demonstrates improving pattern with primarily a theta frequency background rich in beta and alpha frequency activity. Frequent focal sharp waves and spikes are observed but they are no longer continuous and they do not evolve. Despite this, there are discrete seizures characterized by rhythmic repetitive sharp wave discharges including at 7:05p.m. There is little in the way of a clinical correlate. At 5:53a.m., frequent spiking is noted from the left anterior temporal region while the patient is sleeping. By 11:40 a.m., when the patient awakens the next morning, the epileptiform activity is improving although electrode integrity is declining. From 11/24/2010 to 11/25/2010, during this section of the record, there is no clinical information provided. The initial sections of the record on the afternoon of 11/24/2010, were reviewed by the physician and indicated complex partial seizure at 3:50 p.m. The sleep record including 12:44 demonstrates frequent spiking from the left anterior temporal region.   At 6:30 in the morning the patient is actually attempting to speak and then at 6:39, a complex partial seizure occurs. She is not speaking during the seizure. There is no testing performed during the seizure. Over the course of this section of the data 11/24/2010 to 11/25/2010, particularly during the daytime hours when the patient is awake, the background continues to improve when the patient's ability to speak is improving and overall there is a pattern of improved EEG and then a pattern with occasional sharp waves or clinical seizures. On 11/26/2010 to 11/27/2010: Due to the electrode integrity, no interpretations should be made from this section of the data. Although it is clear that there is theta frequency activity in the background, in terms of the possibility of missed seizures, this should not be considered billable data. IMPRESSION: 1.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan and Depakote, Vitamin B12 , Vecuronium at the start of the record. INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Video EEG was employed with seizure and spike detection. This 72 hour continuous LTM study. There was on clinical history provided, no medication list and no documentation that the patient's clinical seizures were observed by the team. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  November 16, 2007 to November 17, 2007. As the tracing opens, the patient has been intubated and received vecuronium. The background EEG is quite slow. Seizure: Time 12:43. The nurse suctions the patient. Following this , nodding and jerking is observed. As the nodding and jerking resolves, no clinical signs or symptoms are observed, but rhythmic repetitive  delta with sharp waves maximum in the left temporal region are observed at 11:44:13. The video is reviewed. There are no clinical signs or symptoms. The activity slows over the course of 5 minutes and is abating by 12:45:19. Seizure time 17:38. The patient is resting comfortably. Somebody has been in and out of the room as can be heard with some background noise. There is some sharply delta in the T1 and T2. By 17:40, the patient begins to have head nodding and jerking first of the head and then upper extremities and then the lower extremities. The jerking is relatively prolong and is persistent at 17:46. The activity begin to slow by 17:48. It has returned by 19:32. No clinical correlates are observed in association with these symptoms. By midnight, this pattern seems to have resolved. The background EEG throughout this section of the record demonstrates a low voltage pattern with some faster frequency activity and some delta. No additional clinical seizures are observed. November 17, 2007 to November 18, 2007. As the tracing opens, there is a fair amount of muscle artifact observed. Behaviorally, the patient has head turned to the right. It is difficult to determine he if has any jerky at that time and the electrode integrity is quite poor. As the day continues, the background EEG is very low voltage and suppressed. There are problems with electrode artifact at T1 and T2, but no additional seizures are observed. The seizure and spike detector is reviewed and no additional electrographic seizures are observed although at times, the quality of the data is suboptimal. Date November 18, 2007 to November 19, 2007. Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at bedside in ICU. There are no clinical notations regarding seizures. Intermittently, the caliber of the EEG data is suboptimal. The background EEG is low voltage, continuous with some artifact in the T1 and T2 electrodes. No epileptiform features are seen in this section of the record. HR: \\t84 bpm IMPRESSION:  This inpatient video EEG monitoring was remarkable for seizures in the first 24 hours of the record some of which were clearly apparent with jerking. Others were characterized by left temporal rhythmic activity. Additional clinical information is essential to known how and why this seizures stopped. CLINICAL  CORRELATION:In terms of the overall background, this pattern is worrisome following cardiac arrest due to the significant degree of background slowing, however, this is of unclear clinical significance in that we so not know what medications were employed at this time. Encouragingly, the patient is starting to show eye movement and spontaneous movement at the close of the recording. LONG-TERM MONITORING  11/19/2007- LAST DAY LTM-07-108 INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is preformed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel as EKG. This is a digital video EEG with seizure and spike detection. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing opened, the background EEG is slow voltage, relatively featureless and slow. The patient does have eye movement. The patient received a bath at 11 a.m. No spontaneous movements are observed, eye opening is observed the background EEG is continuous with beta frequent activity and lower voltage delta and theta. There is clear variability and there is a bit more beta activity  in the frontal regions. As the recording continues, very low voltage pattern is observed. There is a small bifrontal sharp wave observed, left greater than right. This reaches the maximum of 40 microvolts. This is primarily seen when the patient is drowsy. HR: \\t84 bpm IMPRESSION:  This 6 hour continuous video EEG monitoring is remarkable for: 1. \\tMarkedly abnormal background. 2. \\tOccasional frontal sharp wave, left greater than 4. CLINICAL CORRELATION: For an individual now 4-5 days status post anoxic event, this is an encouraging pattern and is continuous with reactivity and variability. The epileptiform activity has abated considerably. No seizure were recorded. This is a technically unsatisfactory recording because there is no historical information and no listing of patient's medications. Additional stimulation of the patient would have been helpful as well. 32 3 2\""

INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Impedances were generally lower than 5 kilohms and left frontal craniotomy defect was noted.  Three clinical seizures were noted. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  From the right hemisphere, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of excess theta and a small amount of beta.  The left hemisphere demonstrates frontally predominant arrhythmic delta activity and a breach rhythm.  Three seizures were recorded.  These are characterized by repetitive sharp activity in the left frontal region with frequency evolution.  Seizure duration 1 minute 20 seconds ranging to 1 minute 40 seconds.  During the seizures, the patient can answer questions, but answers them slowly.  As the recording continues, arrhythmic delta activity and occasional frontal sharp waves were noted. Heart rate:  90 bpm. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Four left frontal seizures characterized by a slowing of the patient's language. Arrhythmic delta activity from the left frontal region. Left frontal sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Thus, EEG demonstrates repetitive seizures, compatible with focal status epilepticus.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The normal wave forms for an adult are not identified.  The LTM is more of a pattern of theta with generous beta. In sleep, although there are some electrode artifacts, there does appear to be some left frontal sharp waves. There are intermittent bursts of rhythmic theta frequency activity in the frontal regions, left more than right. There are many push button events with these typical events in an individual who is quite confused.  He looks to the right and postures and turns to the right. There is little in the way of a clear EEG correlate noted early in the seizures, particularly in this individual who pushes the buttons himself.  There is a subtle change a bit in that there is a bit more theta evolving in the frontal temporal regions, left greater than right.

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 32-year-old male with chronic static encephalopathy. MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Depakote. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in room 447 because of intermittent seizures.  Seizures are unusual in their characteristics and the question was whether they were clonus or actual ictal events.  During the first time sample of 10/26-27/05, no clinical seizures were noted. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is remarkable for a low voltage, relatively featureless pattern.  The normal developmental miles stones of an awake adult are not identified, and the pattern is rich in beta with otherwise a somewhat featureless 3 to 4 Hz background.  Intermittently, as the patient moves about, there is an increase in background muscle.  There are portions of the record where he is resting quietly with a theta pattern and intermittent, asymptomatic increases in background beta.  At 17:43:26 there is a beta asymmetry with more beta from the left hemisphere than the right. There is a bifrontal spike and slow wave at 17:43:38.  At 17:43:46, there is some involuntary movements of the right leg, but they are brief and not clearly associated with this beta frequency activity.  There are occasional isolated spike and wave or sharp and slow wave complexes from the right frontocentral region.  At times, the intermittent bursts of beta are seen from either hemisphere.   In portions of the record, there is an asymmetry with a more sustained, featureless pattern from the right. HR:  110 BPM. Long-Term EEG Monitoring â\\x80\\x93 October 27, 2005 to October 28, 2005 INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the Long-Term Monitoring Unit. The patient experienced a seizure at approximately 12 noon. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: The patient is lying on his bed and moving about.  He demonstrates purposeful use of all extremities.  The first EEG change is at 12:05:56 and is characterized by the abrupt appearance of generalized fast beta frequency activity followed by a high amplitude mixture of alpha and beta frequency activity at 12:01:05.  The behavioral manifestations are tremulousness of the legs, not clonus, with almost a bicycling-like movement at 12:01:17.  The head turns slightly to the right and although it is a little difficult to determine, by the end of the seizure, the head is clearly turned to the right.  The left leg is off the side of the bed, and the right leg is on camera and tremulous.  Abrupt termination is seen at 12:01:39 with abrupt turn-off and then background slowing.  Despite the fast frequency of the activity, there is characteristic frequency evolution. Muscle and chew artifact is seen in the record that follows. The seizure was observed by more than one individual, but there doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to be anyone in the room during the seizure. The interictal EEG shows generalized background slowing with primarily a theta frequency pattern.  There are occasional sharp waves identified in this relatively featureless background.  This can be seen at 12:10 and are sometimes bifrontal and sometimes maximum in the right hemisphere. HR: N/A Long-Term EEG Monitoring â\\x80\\x93 October 28, 2005 â\\x80\\x93 6:00 AM to 11:08 RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The background EEG remains diffusely slow with a rhythmic theta pattern.  There are occasional right hemispheric or right frontal spike and slow waves complexes.  These are never as prominent as seen in the hour following his seizure on the 27th.  There is also some rhythmic frontal 3 to 4 Hz activity identified bilaterally. HR: 96 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG to due: Markedly abnormal background with replacement of normal background with at times a low voltage, featureless pattern and at other times more of a theta frequency pattern. Right frontal sharp and slow wave complexes, as well as some which are maximum in the right central region. Occasional bifrontal sharp waves. A single seizure characterized by a burst of fast activity with clear-cut frequency evolution and somewhat unusual clinical behaviors. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of epilepsy.  The ictal pattern suggests more of a generalized pattern, but there are interictal focal spikes.  Correlation with imaging may be valuable.'"

History of asthma, otherwise normal birth and development. MEDICATIONS: None. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has multiple clinical spells in wakefulness and in sleep.  These are evaluated by the tech and testing is performed to assess responsiveness. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins with the BIOCAL in the first few seconds of the EEG, high amplitude generalized spike and wave activity is seen.  The activity is seen in the first ten seconds of the EEG and occurs in wakefulness.  The recording that follows includes a somewhat drowsy pattern.  There is intermittent occipitally predominant rhythmic delta activity, which is sometimes a bit more prominent on the left than the right. The first well-defined seizure with seizure onset is at 13:08:26.  The child is sitting comfortably.  As is the case with the additional awake seizures, he raises his arms and does not speak.  Testing is performed.  The child speaks afterwards.  He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to be entirely out of it during the spells.  The EEG demonstrates a generalized, 3 to 4 Hz spike and slow wave complex.  This very first spell seems to be a bit more remarkable in the left compared to the right.  There seems to be a little sharp wave that precedes on the left prior to the generalized discharge. The tech started hyperventilation when the first event occurred.  She gives the patient a code word during the first spell and responsiveness is impaired.  During the second seizure at 13:10:06, the patient is given a color.  Once again, he is noted to just very gently raise his arms above his head.  This discharge is similar to the previous with frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity and poly spike and slow wave activity with abrupt cessation when the event is over.  This one seems to be more synchronous with fast activity seen in the frontal regions, but again has just the slightest bit of focality to the left at the onset.  The third seizure occurs at 13:14:00 following hyperventilation.  This seizure is shorter (most seizures are 20 seconds in duration, this one is 14 seconds).  He lifts his leg gently and puts it back down, but the previously described behavior was not seen with the arms.  Additional seizures including that at 13:16:06 occur when the child is asleep.  The epileptiform activity is essentially identical with a very high amplitude, at times greater than 200 msc spike and slow wave discharges.  This is bilateral, but again there is a bit more intense fast activity in the left frontal region than the right.  Following this, the patient is drowsy but not entirely asleep, although there is some stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the drowsy pattern, there is a bit of fast activity in the frontocentral regions.  The fifth seizure is at 13:18:36 with the patient drifting off to sleep.  No clinical signs are seen for this drowsy individual, but testing is not performed with the intention to let the child fall asleep.  Immediately after the discharge, a vertex wave can be seen supporting the appearance of this activity as the child drifts off to sleep.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  The sixth seizure is recorded in stage II sleep at 13:22:46, ending at 13:32:56.  No clinical signs or symptoms are noted with this.  Additional, brief or less than 10 second discharges are also seen in sleep.  There are a handful of poly spike discharges noted in this sleep record, but mostly it is the longer discharges.  An additional discharge is observed at 13:27:36, which seems to slightly disrupt sleep. Stimulation does not elicit a photoparoxysmal response. HR:  100 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Spontaneous and hyperventilation-induced frontally predominant bursts of generalized spike and slow wave activity. Rare bursts of fast activity from the left frontal region in sleep. CLINICAL CORRELATION: On the whole, this EEG is most supportive of a primary generalized mechanism for epilepsy with frontally predominant spike and slow wave activity.  There are some features raising the possibility of a secondarily generalized mechanism including the left frontal activity seen at the onset of this.  This may represent the orientation of the dipole for this individual.  The seizures that occurred were relatively typical of absence seizures.  Correlation with clinical history and imaging is appropriate. Of note, the attending physician of record was notified during the EEG.'"

There are no clinical seizures noted by the team.  There are test push button events. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The background EEG demonstrates some portions of the record with prolonged focal slowing from the left temporal region with sharp waves and spikes.  In sleep, there is frontal delta and occasional vertex waves.  The overall background is slow from both hemispheres, particularly from the left temporal region.  Review of the Stellate detections identifies primarily left temporal, irregular, high amplitude focal slowing and sharp waves. Rare spikes from the right hemisphere are seen. Subclinical seizures are seen at 12:13 and 12:54.  The patient is asleep, lying on one side.  Trains of high amplitude, left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity are identified.  The onset is relatively clear at 12:54, but the off set is a bit more complicated although it is clearly over by 12:59 AM.  A similar discharge is noted at 00:16:44. Stage II sleep is characterized by spindles and can be seen at 4:24 AM.  The focal epileptiform activity is again seen at this time. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 1, 2006 to March 2, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Topiramate, Valproate, and others. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Practice push buttons were recorded, but no clinical seizures were observed by the patient or caregivers. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The seizure file demonstrates intermittent, prolonged bursts of spike and slow wave and focal slowing from the left.  In some cases, these are on the order of minutes, but there is no clear postictal slowing or off set, although there are also portions where this activity has disappeared. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.  The waking record at times demonstrates rhythmic background slowing with primarily a theta frequency pattern and at other times there are left temporal sharp waves or spikes. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 2, 2006 to March 3, 2006 ?SEIZURE TIME - 16:08: The patient is in bed, lying on his left side.  He had some occasional automatisms.  In contrast to previous sections of the record, there seems to be an initially 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified.  There is a fair amount of background muscle artifact and the EEG is best reviewed with both a 60 Hz and 35 Hz filter.  It is noted that at 16:05, the patient seems to be awake, but he is in his usual state of delta.  He has some spontaneous movements, which would suggest that the presence of the 8 to 9 Hz alpha frequency activity is actually pathologic in this patient.  Because the first changes actually resemble normal cerebral activity, it is a bit difficult to be entirely certain where the seizure begins.  At 16:06, the background slowing is noted from the right, but the left seems to be a bit more attenuated.  At 16:07, there are rhythmic, repetitive sharp waves from the left.  This is a more prolonged discharge and has some evidence for frequency evolution. The alpha frequency activity appears at 16:07:47.  During this time, there are no clear clinical correlates for this event.  However, at  16:08:17, the activity that looks like normal alpha activity is likely pathologic in this individual.  At 16:08:28, the right arm movements are identified.  They are initially non-specific, but then are somewhat repetitive.  They do produce some artifact, surprisingly more so than one would expect.  The repetitive circular movements continue.  They are at times almost slow and intermittent and at 16:08:46, there is a background of alpha frequency activity bilaterally with rhythmic 3 to 5 Hz activity picked up in the T1-T2 electrodes.  The activity seems to be slowing with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity, particularly in the temporal regions, with some field of spread to the right at 16:08:54.  The patient remains lying on his left side, paying attention to the left, with sporadic jerking in the minutes that follow.  The background at 16:10 may be slower than previously identified.  Additional high amplitude left anterior temporal spikes are seen at 16:10, which is a non-sustained burst.  An individual enters and leaves the room at 16:13.  The individual canâ\\x80\\x99t be heard on camera and seems to be just off camera.  Patient is noted to be somewhat tremulous and that individualâ\\x80\\x99s observation may be what led to the nurse entering the room at 16:19 and pushing the button.  Patient appears confused in this section of the record, with the caregiver holding his hand. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: Much of the drowsy record is a pattern of theta with small amounts of beta.  The trains of sharp waves and spikes seen from the left were not seen at those other times. CLINICAL NOTE: The precise description of the behavior described in the nurseâ\\x80\\x99s note is not possible to define. In the sleep recording, there were occasional sharp waves noted from the right with some independent right and left temporal sharp waves.  The alpha frequency activity picked up in the clinical seizure seen at 16:07 was not seen at any other time and differed substantially from other portions of the record, some of which do demonstrate sustained left temporal discharges.  There are occasional left temporal sharp waves, but the majority are from the right. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 3, 2006 to March 4, 2006 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates prominent portions of the record with rhythmic continuous theta and sharply contoured slowing, as well as sharp waves from the left temporal region.  These include 14:37 when the patient gets up to go to the bathroom.  At that time, there does seem to be some frequency evolution, the patient is with the nurse who notes no clinical change.  While the patient is off camera in the bathroom, the EEG activity does seem to accelerate and afterwards the rhythmic slowing and sharp waves are less prominent.  Single channel artifact is then picked up at 14:46. Push buttons for this 24-hour section are reviewed and no seizures are seen in association with the push buttons. The overnight recording for the patient is remarkable for sequential loss of electrodes and great amounts of artifact. Reviewing the seizure detection file, no additional seizures are identified. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, March 4, 2006 to March 5, 2006 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient has multiple push buttons when he is in need of things.  These include 9:27 AM, 11:00, 11:02, and 13:35.  This section of the record includes many Stellate detections, all of which are artifact.  There are portions of the record with rhythmic mixed theta and delta. SEIZURE TIME 10:28:45: The patient is in bed on the morning of the 5th.  He was previously asleep in stage II sleep with vertex wave, K complexes, and spindles.  In the time samples previous to this including 10:24, there are trains of spike and slow wave and sharp waves seen from the left temporal region.  There are rare sharp waves identified from the right.  Immediately prior to the discharge, there is some focal slowing and sharp waves, but not as persistent in nature as seen in other epochs of the record.  The first ictal change is seen at 10:28:45 with a burst of low voltage alpha/beta frequency activity.  This is in the left mid-to-posterior temporal regions, spreading to the posterior temporal region at 10:28:55 and then to the anterior temporal region ten seconds later.  The patient is lying on his side, under the sheets.  It is difficult to know which hand starts to tremble, but once the head starts to move at 10:29:25, it is clear that it is the right hand 20 seconds later.  The right hand extends and there are circular movements.  The right hand and then right leg demonstrate tonic and then tonic-clonic activity at 10:29:55.  More generalized tonic-clonic activity is seen ten seconds later.  By 10:32:25, the ictal activity starts to slow with rhythmic paroxysmal slowing.  The seizure demonstrates a clear paroxysmal pattern with slowing and a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.  The precise ending of the seizure is partly obscured by muscle and movement artifact, but it seems to be over by 10:33:35.  The patient has a prolonged and profound postictal period with background slowing.  The video indicates a prolonged period where he is trying to sit up.  He seems to be having difficulty using his right side and he falls backwards in bed.  He starts sliding out of bed at 10:39:05 and at 10:40:06 falls on the floor.  Shortly after this, the clinical team enters and notes that the patient is confused and cannot answer questions lucidly.  As the patient recovers, he is lying in bed and again the left temporal sharp and slow wave activity is identified.  The total seizure duration for this individual is approximately four minutes with a relatively prolonged onset prior to the first ictal change, with clear scalp localization in the temporal regions. SEIZURE TIME 18:10: The patient is sitting in a chair at 18:12:33.  The nurse enters and hands the patient something.  He takes medicine and swallows at 18:12:41.  At 18:12:48, he has a cup of water and medicine in his hand.  The nurse is at the bedside.  At 18:12:54, there is a clear change in frequency of the background with this rhythmic, faster alpha frequency activity.  The patient is sitting.  The nurse is partially obscuring the patient.  He seems to have some automatic behaviors on the right and the left.  The nurse can determine that something is wrong at 18:13:02 when he has an abrupt motor movement.  Unfortunately, the nurse reaches across to help the patient and obscures the camera view of the patient.  The nurse on the camera indicates that there is rapid, clonic activity at 18:13:11.  The video indicates that this is on the right.  The patient seems to have partial impairment of awareness at 18:13:30 and 40, seemingly trying to help the nurse, but then by 18:13:45, this is much more generalized with vocalization.  The clinical team completely obscures the patient, but behind them he seems to be having a tonic-clonic seizure.  This seems to be asymmetric with much more significant tonic-clonic activity on the right compared to the left.  The activity demonstrates frequency evolution, starting to slow at 18:14:25.  The patient remains slumped to the left side at 18:14:36.  The precise end of this seizure is a little difficult to determine.  It is abating by 18:15:24 and is clearly over by 18:15:33.  Total seizure duration is three minutes.  Postictally, there is a fair amount of slowing in the background.  The EKG lead is obscured. RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: There is a fair amount of movement artifact when the patient is up and out of bed.  The overall background when he is awake is slow on the right, and intermittently from the left hemisphere there are bursts and trains of left temporal focal slowing and spikes, most of which are in the mid-to-anterior temporal region.  There are also occasional spike and slow wave complexes noted from the right, particularly in the posterior temporal region.  This section of the overnight recording is remarkable for a fair amount of wakefulness captured late at night.  On one or two occasions, he does seem to have an alpha rhythm on the right.  The EKG lead is uninterpretable.  Notable in this section of the record are frequent left temporal spikes.  Review of this section of the record, using the Stellate seizure detection software, identifies no additional clinical seizures with a burst of fast activity from the left temporal region.'"

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.\\tThe patient had just come from the emergency room having received the Dilantin and he had a seizure in the EEG lab removing his EEG electrodes. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording starts out, the patient is awake and reasonably cooperative.  There is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm observed. As the tracing again, the patient is awake with a 9.5 Hz, 30 mV posterior dominate rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow-rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation is initiated early in the record, at 13:30 the patient is in the middle of hyperventilation.  At this time, 13:30:50 there is an arousal.   This is followed by the appearance of beta at 13:30:55, with repetitive sharp activity and theta maximum in the left temporal region, but with some bilateral representation.  As this continues at 13:31:07, there is little in the way of clinical manifestations.  By 13:31:10, the patient is starting to look from side to side.  He looks somewhat startled or frightened. The technologist calls the patient.  The patient's is observed to be chewing, at 13:31:20, with repetitive sharp waves in left temporal region. He seems to be having automatic movements, face and but the audio is not discernable.  The EEG goes on to be obscured with muscle.  As the patient's behaviors change, at 13:31:44, as he does that he has had head turning to the right. He gets up, he rotating around and looking all the way to the right.  He starts to turn around and around and he puts his head down. At that point, he rolls back towards his back and he has tonic clonic activity with his back to the camera with tonic stiffening and then clonic by 13:32:05. he seems to be having tonic clonic activity in the right arm but the left arm is stiff. Foaming at the mouth is seen at 13:32:19.  while he has eye deviation to the left he is jerking primarily with the right arm.  The characteristic slow pattern at the close of the clonic tonic seizure as the motor activity slows, is observed at 13:32:39. This seizure  ends at 13:32:48.  This is a 2 minute seizure.  Afterwards, the patient is awake, but agitated and he starts to get up and move about. There is a caregiver present with the technologist who applies oxygen.  The patient removes all the electrodes and receives 4 mg of Ativan. The EEG concludes at 13:40:02, where behaviorally the patient is postictal HR:\\t60 to 120 at the maximum during the seizure. IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to; 1. \\tLeft temporal lobe complex partial seizure of 2 minutes duration, CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.  There is a well defined prolonged scalp EEG correlate before the EEG is obscured by muscle and motion artifact.  Additional evaluation and assessment is advised.\""

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrocortisone, Clotrimazole, synthroid, Pantoprazole, Insulin, Heparin, Moxifloxacin INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. No clinical information is provided.  The technologist had difficulty with the patient's electrode placement due to matted hair. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern, intermittently discontinuance.  There is no mention that medications have been changed prior to the baseline, but in contrast to the initial recording, which demonstrated a prominent sharp wave at the vertex, these are not quite as prominent and do seem to have an usual spread starting a little bit at the right and moving towards the left.  There are portions of the record, however, where the activity seems to build up and when it does there is a right frontal discharge.  The discharge in the right frontal region does not correlate exactly with the discharge of Cz, suggesting a complex ictal pattern.  This brief ictal discharge is seen at 18:08:32 and is not associated with a clinical change in the patient's behavior.  There are no additional notes in the record, but intermittently, this activity is seen right frontal and CZ/C4, but it is more fragmented, although clearly some sharp waves can be observed in association with this.  Over the course of the recording the overall background is somewhat slower. No additional notes or maneuvers are demonstrated in this digital video EEG.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 1 0/20 system of electrode placement The patient is intubated. DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The activity from the left is somewhat slow with a mixture of theta frequencies. The right hemisphere demonstrates a high amplitude right frontal spike and polyspike complex, which is somewhat periodic in nature. Waxes and wanes. As the recording continues, eye blinking artifacts were noted that appeared to correlate with the right frontal sharp and slow-wave and periodic complexes. Despite this, and during this, stimulation of the patient clearly produced an alerting with an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity on the left. At 11 :02 Ativan was given. There is a transient decrease in faster activity in the EEG, but by the end of the record, the patient seemed to be more arousal again with faster frequency activity on the left and a periodic complexes in the right frontal region. Heart rate 144 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. A high amplitude periodic complex in the right frontal region. 2. Background slowing more prominent on the right than the left. 3. What appeared to be clinically, simple partial seizures. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The Ativan did reduce the epileptiform activity, but the effect was short lasting and in fact, the patient seemed to be relatively responsive by the end of the EEG.'"

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record for a child who appears quite drowsy. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a posterior dominant rhythm ranging from 7-10 hertz. The overall organization is abnormal for a child of this age. There is excess theta. There also appears to be an asymmetry in terms of faster frequency with greater faster frequency activity in the right frontal region compared to the left. Occasional posterior slowing is observed. In some portions of the record, there is shifting asymmetry and there is more alpha frequency in the left frontocentral region than the right. A clinical seizure occurs at 09:51. The child seems to be drifting off to sleep. A burst of very high amplitude frontally predominant 3.5 hertz activity with activity greater than 200 microvolts is observed. This generalized burst is 10 seconds in duration. The child is given a test word prior to the seizure which she does not recall. Prior to the discharge, the background EEG demonstrates a drowsy pattern and the overall discharge appears to be symmetric and generalized. The technologist serves to alert the patient with a 1 0-second seizure. A second seizure occurs out of sleep at 09:53. This is again 10 seconds in duration and is followed by arousal. A third seizure occurs at 09:54, again as the child seems to be drifting off to sleep and this one demonstrates slower spike and wave activity with 16-second duration. This is again a frontally predominant discharge with slower spike and wave activity and poly spike activity. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.

Shifting asymmetry with asymmetries in both faster frequency activity and delta. 3. Seizures lasting 10-16 seconds in duration with generalized spike and wave activity.

This is an awake and asleep record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG lacks the appropriate organization for a child of this age, although there is a 7 to 8 Hz, 40 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  There is excess background beta and theta, and there is a bit of posterior slowing. The major abnormality in this record is multiple brief bursts of generalized spike and slow wave activity seen throughout the record.

The patient had been having seizures just prior and during the EEG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is poorly responsive verbally. She has frontally predominant spike and wave activity in a slow background noted at the beginning of the record at 1419. The activity starts to transition to more of a frontal focus. It has an unusual dipole seeming to be negative in the lateral temporal regions, positive at the vertex. With the use of an average reference, the activity is clearly most prominent in the frontal regions with positive spike at FP1, F3 at times and then a negative spike in the same region. The activity continues with more a pattern of generalized spike and wave activity. Two mg Ativan is administered at 4:25. The patient starts sitting up after the Ativan and asks to use the bed pan. After the Ativan and the bedpan, the activity is not quite as prominent but persists. It is primarily a frontally predominant bilateral process, although a little more prominent on the left.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient is intubated and ventilator dependent. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, disorganized, and diffusely slow.  The normal posterior alpha rhythm is absent.  There is an excessive amount of diffuse beta superimposed on the background.  Polymorphic delta activity is seen in the right central and temporal areas, as well as shifting arrhythmic delta activity in both hemispheres, more prominently in the right centrotemporal area.  As the tracing continues, a frontal dominant burst of theta activity lasting for about ten seconds was observed without clinical seizure correlation. HR:  96 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Disorganized and diffusely slow background. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity prominently in the right centrotemporal area. Excessive beta activity. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG pattern is suggestive of a severe cerebral dysfunction involving both gray and white matter, as well as the central nuclei in the midline.  The shifting arrhythmic polymorphic delta activity seen prominently in the left centrotemporal area is indicative of an underlying pathological process such as the multiple brain metastases.  This tracing also supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.  No clinical seizures were observed.  The patient is not in status epilepticus.  The primary result was communicated to the primary team.'"

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is treated with Fosphenytoin and Ativan during the EEG.  Clinically, she is blinking as the record opens, but is comatose. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern with a marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The activity from the right hemisphere is low voltage and suppressed.  The activity from the left hemisphere demonstrates higher amplitude delta with an occipital/posteriotemporal high amplitude periodic discharge with a generous field of spread including C3 and P3.  There is also some underlying beta in the frontal regions.  Stimulation of the patient does not seem to alter the periodic complex from the left hemisphere, which has a periodicity of approximately 2 Hz, but does seem to affect the other associated faster frequency activity on the left.  The right hemisphere remains suppressed.  As the recording continues, the periodicity of the epileptiform activity starts to slow to 1 per second.  This is noted after the first 2 mg of Ativan.  With the use of Fosphenytoin and Ativan, the activity on the right becomes lower voltage and slower, and the activity on the left continues to slow, sometimes slowing to a periodicity of less than 1.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a 48-hour study. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is in the ICU.  The nurse is working with the technologist. There is a seizure seen at 16:45:48. The patient is not in great focus on the video, but he seems to have subtle jerking of his head with the onset of the activity.  The audio is not working, but reviewing the video, there does seem to be a clinical correlate with jerking of the head when the video can be seen, but for much of the time the tech is talking to someone else, obscuring the patient, and the audio is off so it is not possible to know when the clinical team recognizes the seizure.  The first seizure is three minutes in duration and begins with right frontal sharp and slow wave activity and a repetitive spike pattern.  It lasts three minutes with clear frequency evolution, as well as temporal spread in the right hemisphere.  By 16:46:55, it is involving the left hemisphere.  By 16:47:25, the clinical team may be noting the activity, although it is difficult to tell.  They are moving the electrodes, and reviewing the video it is hard to see the patient moving at that time. The clinical teams moves away from the camera at 16:49 and at that point, the generalized approximately 3 to 5 Hz spike and wave activity pattern is seen with significant muscle and movement artifact maximum on the left, but with clear involvement of the left.  The activity demonstrates a frequency evolution from 5 to 3 Hz and then slowing and ends abruptly with postictal attenuation.  In terms of involvement of the left hemisphere, the occipital region seems to be involved more on the right, more posteriorly than the anterior region. SEIZURE TIME 16:51:18: The patient is at the bedside and the techs are working with the electrodes.  The seizure again begins with a right frontal, high amplitude spike and slow wave activity.  The initial onset is a little bit more subtle and in this longer discharge, approximately 6.5 minutes, there is little in the way of clinical signs. TIME SAMPLES: During this section of the record, there are right frontal sharp and slow wave complexes with a pattern of intrahemispheric asymmetry and disruption of faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere compared to the left.  There is also more arrhythmic delta activity from the right than the left and the phase reversal for much of the epileptiform activity is right frontal, although some is maximum at T4, and there is a generous field of spread at Fp2, F4 for the primary frontal spike. As the recording continues, there is a clear improvement in the background from the left hemisphere with the appearance of more alpha and theta frequency activity.  Over time, the background from the right demonstrates some variability, but in the initial hours following the two seizures, every ten-second epoch demonstrates some sharp waves.  By the early morning hours, the sharp waves on the right are beginning to wane, becoming more subtle in the background, slower amplitude, and transitions from spikes to sharps in terms of duration.  The first 24-hour time sample demonstrates gradual abatement of the sharp waves, which have transitioned to primarily a right frontal sharp wave. Long-Term Monitoring, September 9, 2006 to September 10, 2006 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The recording on 09/09 demonstrates gradual diminution, a fading of the epileptiform activity from the right frontal region.  The overall background from the left demonstrates some variability with some portions being much slower than the right.  By the close of the second 24-hour section, on the morning of the 10th, the epileptiform activity is clearly fading from the right hemisphere, although the intrahemispheric asymmetry persists. HR:  88 BPM. IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This 48-hour EEG monitoring is remarkable for: Two seizures in the first 24-hours. Initially quite prominent epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere, fading by the morning of the 10th. Intrahemispheric asymmetry with greater slowing on the right.'"

The sharp waves are maximum in the right and involve T2, C6, and spread to C4. The patient has occasional sleep myoclonus, which produces an arousal from stage I sleep to stage II sleep, but there is no associated epileptiform activity.  Hyperventilation produces slowing of the record with bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude frontal delta.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record. HR:  66 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Rare, right temporal sharp waves with an unusual field of spread including the central and posterior temporal regions. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The rhythmic theta frequency activity identified in the temporal regions in drowsiness is a normal variant. However, the three sharp waves described in the right centrotemporal region did not have a field of spread that was consistent with a normal variant and one was seen in stage II sleep.'"

The patient is now experiencing staring spells at work.  Previous history of tonic-clonic seizures. MEDICATIONS: Norvasc. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 to 50 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  The major abnormalities occur around the time of photic stimulation.  The tech starts to awaken the patient for photic.  A brief burst lasting just under one second is seen with high amplitude, sharply contoured activity without a really well-defined spike and slow wave complex, but with notched frontal activity.  Reviewing the burst with different montages, it seems to phase reverse slightly to the left. 1 seizure occurred in the EEG lab at 13:51.  This follows photic stimulation, but does not occur during photic stimulation.  The patient is resting quietly with her eyes closed.  As the seizure begins at 13:51:57, no clinical signs or symptoms are noted.  The technologist notes the change in behavior.  The patientÕs eyes open at 13:52:10.  The technologist asks the patient questions at 13:52:16.  The patient opens her eyes and swallows.  When asked where she is she replies that she is in the neurologistÕs office.  She remains somewhat confused in the minutes that follow.  The tech calls the patient at 13:52:39.   At 13:52:46, she sits, staring blankly, and then she starts to rub her eyes in her head.  The tech asks if she is okay.  At this point, when the tech is asking the patient questions, the seizure has ended and the patient is confused. EEG characteristics of this seizure include the appearance of rhythmic theta frequency activity, which is more remarkable in the posterior regions.  This seizure seems to start with some low voltage fast activity and then some rhythmic theta, more remarkable in the posterior regions and perhaps maximum in the right posterior region.  Reviewing this seizure with a circle montage, seems to confirm a phase reversal in the right occipitotemporal region but also involving the right central region, nearly isoelectric Cz to C4.  The activity shows frequency evolution and seems to occur in two phases with secondary build-up at 13:52:19 with fast activity and more of a generalized appearance.  The activity ends at 13:52:51 as the patient starts to rub her head with postictal slowing. HR:  96 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Complex partial seizure, which was difficult to localize and which may have had some generalized features at the start, but with some evidence of focality in the same seizure. 2. An unusual paroxysmal burst frontal in nature. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of an underlying seizure disorder.  There may be more than one contributing factor for this patientÕs seizures.  This EEG did not provide adequate localization for the seizures that this individual experienced.'"

INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is obtunded without clear clinical seizures identifiable. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD FOR 12/27-28/02: During this portion of the record, there are frequent spike and slow wave complexes identified particularly on the date of the 27th.  There is also some periodic delta activity, but there are none of the characteristic frequency evolution seizures or the seizures that were characterized by the buzz of the bursts of fast activity.  In the transition after midnight on the 28th, the EEG is lower voltage and overall much more suppressed.  At the conclusion of the first 24 hours at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 29th, the EEG pattern continues to demonstrate a overall low voltage suppressed pattern without additional seizures. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD FOR 12/28-29/02: In this section of the record, the background EEG has some occasional issues with quality.  The patient has some evidence of reactivity.  Despite the technical issues with the EEG, the EEG remains continuous with an increasingly rich background with bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta or theta activity.  There is less of the suppression that was seen in earlier portions of the record and there is some chaotic, higher amplitude arrhythmic delta activity, although the pattern remains low to medium amplitude overall.  The epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere is clearly beginning to abate in this section of the record. IMPRESSION: Abnormal, continuous bedside EEG monitoring due to: Initial status epilepticus with repetitive seizures with a focal or partial pattern followed by intermittent suppression of the seizures and then a pattern of fast activity which was to some extent bilateral.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low to medium amplitude with rhythmic theta activity and a posterior dominant rhythm of 5 to 7 Hz. There are intermittent bursts of theta and a relatively low voltage pattern.  As the patient becomes drowsy or in quiet wakefulness, there are bursts of frontally predominant spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave activity.

The patient is intubated and responds to tactile stimuli by moving about. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The most prominent features are a posteriorly predominant periodic complex which appears maximum in the right rather than the left.  The periodic sharp activity in this record has variable fields and variable maximum, including 02, T6 and even F8 phase reversal.

There are independent, periodic sharp waves observed from either hemisphere, some of which are asynchronous and some of which are seen exclusively unilateral on the left or the right, although the right occipital seems to be the most prominent discharge in this record. The background includes smaller amounts of irregular theta and delta as well as intermittently discontinuous pattern.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Multiple push button events are identified, but not for the patientâ\\x80\\x99s seizures.  In addition, the patient has multiple absence spells.  She receives Keppra (Levetiracetam) during this record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There are occasional bursts of isolated, frontally predominant symmetric high amplitude 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  The overall waking record is at the limits of normal in terms of organization for an individual of this age.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  In the transition to sleep, there are some briefer spike and slow wave complexes, as well as some longer bursts.  In addition, while there is no definite dyshormia, in some sections in the sleep record there is subtle sharply contoured activity in the frontal regions, but no clear asymmetry. SEIZURES: There are multiple push buttons by the family: 17:13, 18:14, 19:19, and 20:39.  These do not appear to be seizures.  Given the language (Arabic), it is not clear what the behavior was even when reviewing the video, but these are no seizures and in some cases, when the nurse enters, the patient verbalizes in English that she is fine and that she did not experience any symptoms. Multiple bursts of generalized spike and slow wave activity are identified.  The majority of these are 8 seconds in duration.  In some cases but not in every case it is possible to identify a clinical correlate, which includes eye blinking.  The resolution of the camera does not permit identification of the facial twitching seen in the lab.  In addition, sometimes the patient scratches her scalp during the seizures.  The minute the discharge stops, the patient is back to her usual self.  She is sitting parallel rather than facing her mother and the mother never identifies these discharges.  In the initial portions of the record, they occur approximately one per hour including 4:13:46, 6:59, 18:35, 16:09, 20:07, 37:00, and 21:40.  In addition they are seen at 7:00 AM and at 10:21 AM.  There are some computer problems and a loss of data at 3:00 AM, but it appears in wakefulness in the initial portions of the record that the activity is approximately once per hour and the limited data seen on the morning of the 1st suggests that the activity has slowed to a frequency of less than one per hour. At 00:55:45, the patient is sleeping.  The resolution of the video is poor, but she has a burst of frontally predominant generalized activity lasting approximately three seconds followed by an arousal without clear clinical correlate.  This is one of the infrequent times that this activity can be seen. HR:  96 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Bursts of frontally predominant 3 to 6 Hz spike and slow wave activity, some of which are clinically significant. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background EEG is at the limits of normal.

The patient received Ativan during the EEG and events end when the EEG is over. This is a 33 minute EEG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. It is difficult to see her actually jerking, DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG shows a pattern of frontally predominant, high amplitude, sharp and slow wave activity of approximately 5 Hz. It is present in the frontal regions bilaterally. The clinical correlates, described by bedside examiners, include ocular twitching. The amplitude of the frontal spike and slow wave, and sharp and slow wave complexes ranges between 50 and 100 microvolts. In addition, there is some frontal fast activity. The patient is clinically hyperventilating at this time. The frontal, ictal activity demonstrates a beta frequency evolution, typically transitioning into activity that is faster than 4 Hz and is associated with frontal fast activity. The Ativan clearly produces a dramatic attenuation of the epileptiform activity and the record transitions to a lower voltage theta pattern. At the close of the record, the record is low voltage theta. After the Ativan is given, the respiratory rate slows to 25 .

Another pattern is an 8 Hz ictal alpha rhythm which includes some sharp waves and a third of them is right periodic sharp activity . At about 3:27:37 there is 1 episode where there is an increase in the right sided frequency, which is followed by bilateral alpha, which is then buried by tonic clonic muscle activity. This muscle activity involves a very distinct frequency evulsion that is distinctive for true tonic clonic seizure.  Followed by this activity there is delta activity bilaterally which then ends first on the left side, followed by the right side before returning to baseline.

Most notable is the high amplitude spike and wave or sharp and slow wave complex in the left hemisphere with a generous field of spread, maximum at T1 but really with a field throughout the left hemisphere. These epileptiform complexes are seen several times in every 10-second epoch and are associated with aftergoing slow waves. They start to build into bursts of activity by 10:51:21 which is 11 minutes into the EEG. They evolve into a seizure at 10:51:41 with a train of repetitive left temporal mixed frequency activity, alpha and theta frequency activity, and underlying delta. This demonstrates frequency evolution. The seizure appears to be over at 10:53:31. Clinical correlates of the seizure include staring and an increase in heart rate. The epileptiform  activity shows brief bursts but no sustained discharges  after the event. HR:\\t100 bpm IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 1. \\tAn electrographic  seizure localizing to the left anterior temporal region. 2. \\tHigh amplitude left temporal spikes. 3. \\tBackground slowing. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG demonstrates a focal mechanism for this patient's seizures. Additional monitoring may be important.\""

Occasional posterior slow waves of youth are identified.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing brief bursts of frontally predominant 3 to 6 Hz spike and wave activity.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using intracranial electrodes. The montage is unchanged.  No clinical seizures are identified by the clinical team, but subclinical seizures can be identified with the nurse at the bedside during this. INTERICTAL ACTIVITY: In the interictal section, there are high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes, some of which are very high amplitude with a generous field of spread; in some cases appearing maximum at contact LM12 rather than 1, 2, and other smaller spikes in the mesial temporal region, again typically anteriorly although somewhat LM8.  There is some delta picked up at LM13, 14 and 18, 19, 20.  There is clear evidence of a change in the patientâ\\x80\\x99s mental status with awake and asleep patterns identified. There is single filled channel, almost artifactual-looking discharges, with a maximum at LL14 involving 13, 14, and 15 on the lateral temporal chain, which would be in the posterior section of the third row of intracranial electrodes.  On the single channel, on some occasions, it does seem to wax and wane and it does appear prior to the patientâ\\x80\\x99s seizure.  It may or may not correlate with some of the delta seen in the more lateral electrodes of the LM or mesial-placed grid. The EEG was reviewed well before the event.  The patient had been sleeping until 20:46:16.  The nurse walks in and startles the patient.  This produces a dramatic change in the EEG with an attenuation compatible with an alerting.  Prior to this time, there had been some spiking in some of the anterior contacts of both grids â\\x80\\x93 the right strip electrode remaining quiet.  At 20:46:44, there is the appearance of rhythmic activity out of the LL14 contact.  It looks single channel and artifactual, however, the LL9, 10 electrode seemed to be involved perhaps seven seconds into this discharge and does seem to have a correlation with this.   There is this activity, which seems to be electropositive at LL14, but it does seem to have a relationship to the activity at LL9, 10.  This can be seen at 20:46:57.  By 20:47:15, there is more clear involvement of the subtemporal grid with involvement of LM8, 9, 10, and LM13, 14, 15.  The activity continues with this electropositive activity at LL14, but there is a pattern of repetitive spiking at LL11, 12. With a seizure start time of 20:47:12, by 20:47:26, there is involvement in the left subtemporal chain and at 20:48:02, there is a pattern of repetitive spike at LM8, 9, 10, as well as LM12, 13, 14, which is compatible with the lateral electrodes from the mesial strip.  Coincident with this, there is this rhythmic electropositive activity at contact 13, but with more repetitive spike activity at LM11, 12, and that 11, 12 activity is similar to the onset of the patientâ\\x80\\x99s first seizure on the first day. The nurse is at the bedside and no clinical changes are identified. The seizure shows gradual evolution of frequency, which is most prominent in the chain of electrodes LM11 through 15, demonstrating paroxysmal slowing with abrupt termination at 20:48:40.  Afterwards, there is background slowing.  At that time, the nurse leaves.  The patient had been interactive in the beginning and the nurse leaves during what appears to be a subclinical seizure.  The patient is resting with her head to the side of the bed. HR:  85 BPM. BRIEF IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: The EEG recording during this section of the record identified yet another subclinical seizure.  The best localization for this one is in the same lateral temporal strip, but posterior to the first one.  There are concerns that the actual onset of the seizure might have been a bit challenging because of the fact that there is an unusual field with electropositivity at 14 and then the train of epileptiform activity that follows that. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, July 16, 2006 to July 17, 2006 INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using intracranial electrodes. The nurses do not identify any seizures, the computerized seizure and spike detector does not identify any seizures, and review of the data does not identify clinically subclinical seizures. INTERICTAL SPIKING: Review of the EEG demonstrates occasional high amplitude mesial temporal spiking from the left subtemporal grid.  There are rare portions of the record with some spiking at LM14, 15 as well.  There is occasional fast activity in the strips.  In the lateral grid, there are two patterns with spiking at LL16, 17 and delta in the posterior contacts of the strips. There seems to be an observation that there is more spiking at LL16, 17 when there is no spiking in the mesial temporal area or vice versa. There is an unusual discharge noted at 01:27 AM, which is asymptomatic.  The patient is awake at the time.  The two strips are compared.  There is some periodic delta from the first two strips in the LL grid which includes 1 through 10 followed by some periodic delta.  This is followed by extremely high amplitude spiking from the mesial temporal electrodes and ends with delta at LL13, 14. HR: approximately 60 BPM. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, July 17, 2006 to July 18, 2006 INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using intracranial electrodes. The nurses do not identify any seizures, the computerized seizure and spike detector does not identify any seizures, and review of the data does not identify clinically subclinical seizures. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The left subtemporal strip LM continues to demonstrate a high amplitude spike pattern with primarily mesial temporal spiking.  There are bursts of fast activity, and on rare occasions the same fast activity is seen in the right temporal strip.  By 8:00 AM, the ground is lost and this seems to tamp down the activity from the left mesial and anterior contacts in the LM or subtemporal grip. From the left lateral neocortical grid, there are portions where there is variability with 2 Hz, almost monomorphic or mono-channel delta seen at contacts 16 and then migrating to 19, 20 and occasionally more diffusely throughout.  The LL strip has variability with some portions of the record being much more sharply contoured than others and without as much in the way of underlying epileptogenic activity.  At 3:10 AM, an alpha theta pattern is picked up throughout.  The pattern resembles a somewhat awake or drowsy, well-organized cortical pattern.  There is some spiking seen at 3:12:06 out of LM13, 14; 14, 15, but there is no clear ictal nature to this discharge.  The theta frequency activity doesnâ\\x80\\x99t evolve as would be anticipated in a seizure. HR: 80 BPM. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, July 18, 2006 to July 19, 2006 INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using intracranial electrodes. The nurses do not identify any seizures, the computerized seizure and spike detector does not identify any seizures, and review of the data does not identify clinically subclinical seizures. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the EEG continues to show high amplitude spiking in the left mesial electrodes primarily in the first three rows, but some in the fourth.  There is some high amplitude more diffuse spikes and some that have a more restricted field in the first or the second contacts.  There seems to be an artifact with delta picked up at LM13, 14 and at LL17, 18.  Because of that delta, the tech removes that from the chain.  At 17:10 and at 18:39, there is a pattern of a greater fast activity and some theta activity from the left lateral grid â\\x80\\x93 in this case, seen primarily in the first chain at LL2, 3; 3, 4; 4, 5, but without clinical correlate. HR: 70 BPM. COMMENT: The LL strips seem to be significantly quieter than it had been in previous days. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, July 20, 2006 to July 21, 2006 SEIZURE â\\x80\\x93 Time 10:16 AM on 7/20/06:  The patient is in bed.  She is watching television or staring off into space.  She is not aware of any specific behavioral changes.  She is later not aware that she has been incontinent.  The EEG demonstrates a subtle pattern of repetitive sharps at LL19, 20.  These are of medium amplitude, 5 to 7 Hz, and then transitions to a pattern of a repetitive spike, which can be clearly differentiated from EKG and, in fact, seems to be electronegative at LL20.  This is seen at 10:17:23 and 10:17:24.  The left subtemporal grid appears to be relatively uninvolved.  There is some electronegativity at LM14, 15, which would be in the same approximate region.  There is also a little bit of a beta buzz identifiable in the LM1, 2, but this does not seem in any way differentiated from the repetitive high amplitude approximately 1 to 2 Hz spike at LL19, 20.  This is associated with a field of delta in LL13, 14; 14, 15, which would be posterior in the superior temporal gyrus, assuming that LL19, 20 is the middle temporal gyrus.  This activity clearly involves the superior temporal strip by 10:23:53.  It remains at approximately 2 Hz.  It stops at 10:23:33.  By the time the seizures ends, the left LM subtemporal strip is involved; in fact, contacts LM13, 14, which would have been lateral neocortical in the third strip, are involved at 10:21:13, and the pattern of repetitive spiking can be seen at 10:21:20.  The activity stops quite clearly in the lateral temporal strip and in the subtemporal at contacts 13, 14, the spiking seems to peter out more than stopping paroxysmal with more of a field and is associated with focal delta at 10:23:10.  The right subtemporal strip remains uninvolved.  This activity waxes and wanes and returns at 10:26:07, but is actually unique at that point in that there is electropositivity at 13, 14.  The activity from the lateral temporal grid builds back up at 10:26:20, however, there is also activity in the subtemporal strip suggesting ongoing enhancement of epileptogenicity with, in this case, a lateral temporal strip likely building up to the activity seen at LM13, 14 at 10:26:33.  At the same time, there is clearly a beta buzz with frequency evolution and an electropositivity throughout the strips LL13, 14, 15.  The second seizure is clearly spreading at 10:27:04, with more extensive involvement in the lateral temporal chain, and looking at the subtemporal strip, there is a pattern of exquisite spiking at LM8, 9 and then really a more vigorous pattern at 10:27:13.  By 10:29:43, it now involves LM4, 5.  The seizure has an unusual pattern because it seems to generate more anteriorly over time so it starts out neocortically and posteriorly and by 10:30:14, it is actually in the lateral temporal strips LM3, 4 and LM4, 5, which can clearly be identified using a higher sensitivity of 20.  At that time, LL11, 12 and LL12, 13 demonstrate this spiking.  The seizure seems to wax and wane in the lateral temporal strip, but is over at 11:32.  In that strip, in the lateral temporal grid and in the subtemporal grid, the off-set is not quite as clear, but it seems to peter out at 10:30:55, essentially perhaps a minute earlier. Of note, the seizure that starts at 10:17 and is localized to contacts LL19, 20, seems to build up and give rise to the second seizure, which is at 10:26 and starts LL13, 14.  That second seizure seems to mediate more towards the subtemporal and anteriotemporal spread. Of note, the seizure is associated with head turning and is not associated with profound autonomic changes seen with the seizures that generated to the frontal region that had a tonic-clonic component. SEIZURE â\\x80\\x93 Time 02:19 AM on 7/20/06:  The patient is asleep.  The EEG prior to this seizure is reviewed.  There are transitions to and from sleep.  There are also one or two episodes where the patient briefly disconnects herself; this can be confirmed not to be an electrodecremental response because the EEG lead is involved.  Although there is waxing and waning, there is a sharp wave picked up in the most anterior contacts LL11, 12 and LL16, 17.  There is the delta that waxes and wanes, and there is intermittent increased beta activity in the frontal regions.  The spiking waxes and wanes and can be seen at 02:23 and is quite prominent at 02:23:17. This seizure has only the lateral temporal grid.  There is an attenuation of the background at 02:26:30 and is most intense in 13, 14, 15.  It is approximately nine seconds in duration and is followed by alpha frequency activity generating out of LL11, 12 and 16, 17.  Behaviorally, the patient lifts her head up as the EEG attenuates.  As fast activity is generated at LL11, 12 and 16, 17, she starts to put her head back down.  Then, as tonic-clonic activity emerges, there is motor activity emerging out at 02:26:48.  She starts to have initially shuffling and then goes on to have tonic-clonic activity.  The tonic-clonic activity is rapid, gradually demonstrating frequency evolution.  The seizure ends at 02:27:51.  In the postictal section, there is some electropositive activity picked up in several of the electrodes and then what may be artifact versus genuine at LL18 and 19 in the postictal section.  The cerebral activity gradually returns, but there seems to be an artifact at 18, 19, which was previously described.  The nurse enters and works with the patient and there is a background of generalized slowing. For this seizure, there were clear clinical signs with the attenuation suggesting either: 1) the immediate change in the EEG produces a change in the patientâ\\x80\\x99s behavior; or 2) that the seizure was generated from some other region in the brain not captured by the LL grid, as would make sense if it came from the LM grid. SEIZURE â\\x80\\x93 Time 7:47 AM on 7/21/06:  The patient is sleeping.  The seizure is remarkable for an interesting pattern.  There is a change in the EEG at 7:35:22, well before the clear sustained ictal pattern.  There seems to be the appearance of rhythmic sharply contoured delta and paroxysmal slowing that is picked up in the subtemporal strips LM6, 7; 7, 8, and 13, 14 at 7:35:42.  Coincident with this, there is activity with sharply contoured delta in the third strip on the lateral temporal grid, which is LL11, 12 through 14, 15.  This activity also waxes and wanes.  It appears that the delta may be leading forward to generate the seizure. The delta comes and goes in the time samples beforehand, such as 7:48:07 there is spiking seen from the anterior mesial contacts at LL1, 2, with the waxing and waning delta in the second build up of the seizure and spiking in the mesial contact 6, 7.  This pattern is seen prior to the actual seizure itself. The first clear persisting building up into a seizure change is seen in the left lateral temporal grid at 7:49:04, and starts with some spiking at LL13, 14, 15 out of a background that has some spiking with a gradual increase in beta frequency activity.  Of note, there is the beta activity that seems to be building in the frontal region and, with the use of different sensitivities, in the mesial temporal strip.  At 7:49:04, there is a high amplitude activity seen in the third strip, which should correlate to the superior temporal gyrus.  It is high amplitude and, in fact, seems to start in the anterior contacts and then spread to the posterior contacts over time, suggesting that although it seems to be high amplitude posterior using the strip electrodes â\\x80\\x93 time wise â\\x80\\x93 was generated at 11, 12 but is higher voltage at 14, 15. Looking at the strip that is immediately inferiorly in the middle temporal gyrus; again the spikes appear to be demonstrating some degree of time lag.  They are easiest to be seen in the posteriotemporal strips because of the voltage, but actually seem to be generating at LL11, 12.  This activity is clearly defined at LL11, 12, with a generous field of spread to the electrodes immediately posterior and inferior to it.  Reviewing the subtemporal strips, they do demonstrate some spiking, but with the high amplitude spiking it is difficult to see a clear change in them until a chain starts to build up at 7:49:15, which is subtle but there is an unequivocal change in the EEG at 7:49:17 with perhaps 30 seconds of 6 to 8 Hz activity building up before that.  When the change is seen in the subtemporal electrode at 7:49:17, that change is seen in the anterior electrode LM6, 7; 11, 12, and to a lesser extent 18, 19.  At 18, 19, the frequency is 3 to 4 Hz and at 7:49:15, this is probably the identical activity seen in the lateral temporal electrodes, again highest amplitude posterior but occurring first anteriorly in the neocortical region.  At 7:49:19, as the seizure spreads to the mesial temporal electrodes, there is a very intense beta buzz with activity that measures out at more than 20 Hz, although it does appear to be much faster.  On the lateral temporal grid, at 7:49:16, the activity attenuates and there is a burst of lower voltage alpha frequency activity, which is seen with the flattening in the neocortical region and spreading to the subtemporal strip.  As it spreads to the subtemporal strip, there is fast activity, but not without this almost artifactual-looking fast activity coming out of the neocortical strips and then this very intense buzz of activity in the mesial temporal electrodes.  At this point, the activity immediately generalizes throughout the available electrodes, spreading later into the right temporal region.  This activity includes intense paroxysmal activity, most intense in the temporal electrodes, rather than in the frontal regions.  The activity is high amplitude.  It has a triangular appearance in all of the temporal contacts, but has a repetitive alpha frequency activity as it spreads to the right temporal region.  The activity demonstrates paroxysmal spike and wave activity of a tonic-clonic seizure, with gradual frequency evolution over time.  This tonic-clonic pattern is a bit more apparent in the lateral temporal strip and in the subtemporal strip, there is poly spike and slow wave activity with frequency evolution going from theta to delta spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave, which is very high amplitude.  The seizure ends in the left subtemporal strip or the mesial temporal strip at 7:50:50 and on the contralateral strip, ending early at 7:50:37.  Correlating the two at 7:50:27, the activity is most intense and is clearly more sustained with a frequency pattern in the left subtemporal strip, which is the most intense, and is faster frequency in the range of alpha and theta frequency regional spike and slow wave activity.  The activity is extremely high amplitude and using a sensitivity of 300, it is difficult to say where the generator is. DESCRIPTION OF SEIZURE: At 6:49:39 on the 21st, the patient gently starts to stir.  She is underneath the covers, her arms come up.  She is observed to have dilated pupils.  The nurse enters at 7:49:50.  The patient rolls over on her left side in contrast to the other seizure in which she rolled over to the right.  The nurse holds onto the patient.  Although the back of the patient can be seen, focal shaking of the right arm is identified with tonic-clonic activity.  The second nurse enters to assist.  The focal motor jerking demonstrates frequency evolution starting at faster frequencies evolving to theta frequency activity, gradually slowing at 7:50:23/24.  The seizures ends in the lateral temporal strip with ongoing delta in LL7, 8, 9 and 13, 14, but the patient continues to have tonic-clonic activity with the same high amplitude spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave activity from the left subtemporal region.  There is some artifact picked up in the subtemporal strips.  The seizure ends in the left subtemporal strip ending at 7:50:50 with profound background suppression and then a pattern of positive discharge at LL8, 9. CLINICAL SEIZURE â\\x80\\x93 Time 17:16: The patient is resting comfortably on her side, and she is drowsy. This EEG can be dictated with the EEG and then the Clinical Correlate.  The seizure begins with a buzz in the mesial electrodes - the most mesial and anterior electrodes of LM6, 7; 11, 12.  In addition, there appears to be a lower voltage buzz in the LM2, 3 contacts, however, that change seems to have slightly different  ______________.  This buzz is accompanied by focal spikes in other electrodes including LL13, 14 and LL19, 20, which would be a bit posterior in the neocortical chain.  There is also a subtle change in LL4, 5, with a bit more irregular theta suggesting a wider area of epileptogenicity.  The alpha/beta buzz activity persists in the subtemporal grid.  It is approximately 15 Hz in frequency, and it demonstrates frequency evolution at 17:17:13.  It becomes a triangular-shaped, 5 Hz sharp wave.  The activity spreads to the lateral temporal chain at 17:17:20, as the patient sits up.  By 17:17:29, the persistent primarily theta frequency activity seen throughout the temporal chain transitions to a spike and slow discharge, building up and spreading laterally throughout the LM chain.  By 17:17:20, the activity clearly involves the two chains from the lateral temporal grid, which overlie the superior and middle temporal gyrus with initially 6 Hz and then faster frequency activity evolving and at 17:17:20, it is clear that this has evolved from a discharge in the subtemporal strip to one that now involves the lateral temporal strip. Coincident with this, the patient sits up and turns her head to the right. There is subtle involvement in the right subtemporal grid at 17:17:35 with clear involvement in the right subtemporal strip at 17:17:37, although that is not sustained.  In addition, this waxes and wanes, re-building again at 17:17:47.  Coincident with the involvement of the right subtemporal strip, is involvement in the left frontal region.  The activity evolves into a fast, generalized spike and slow wave complex, which is very high amplitude.  It starts out as 6 to 7 Hz, and then gradually evolves over time.  It is 4 to 5 Hz at 17:18; 3 Hz at 17:18:37; 2 Hz at 17:18:20.  During this time, the patient demonstrates initially sinus tachycardia with some dysrhythmia.  It ends at 17:18:36 in the lateral temporal grid and at 17:18:40 in the subtemporal grid with profound postictal slowing.  The patient is observed on the telemetry to have persistent tachycardia following a seizure.  She has a long postictal experience and in the times that follow, at 17:31:13, she is still postictal.  The marked background suppression seen at 17:15:23, starts to resolve at 17:15:43.  The activity transitions from a low voltage record to a higher voltage by 17:39.  Curiously, at 17:18:37, the same buzz identified prior to the seizure is seen in the same fashion in the left LM1, 2 electrode.  The patient is resting at that time.  The buzz seems to be a biological and clear entity, with involvement of LM6, 7.'"

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 60 uV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is some eye movement artifact picked up and on two occasions, there is a question of underlying sharp waves from the left temporal region with the eye movements.  At the close of hyperventilation and in the transition to drowsiness, there are discrete, symmetric, frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave complexes, some of which have four phases, but none with five phases to meet the poly spike and slow wave criteria.

The patient received 2 mg of Ativan during the EEG. There is very little testing of the patient during the EEG, but he is laying with eyes open, motionless in the bed. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a lower voltage, slow pattern with delta and theta. The most prominent features in this record are high amplitude sharp wave spike or polyspike maximum in the right posterior quadrant with some variability, sometimes P4 or 02 maximum, sometimes T6. In addition, recurrent seizures are characterized by rhythmic repetitive theta frequency activity and repetitive spike activity with frequency evolution. The seizures terminate abruptly. Seizure duration is 1 minute 40 seconds to 40 seconds in duration. As the recording continues, the seizures start to merge into a less discreet pattern. HR: 109 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Status epilepticus with a pattern maximum in the right posterior temporal region. LONG TERM MONITORING 11/24-28/2010 EEG LTM 10-135 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage slow pattern on the left. The right hemisphere has bursts of polyspike activity from the right central and parietal region. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. In the initial section of the record at 4:06, the bursts continue to build up, wax and wane. By 5:01 p.m., interestingly, the EEG is more continuous and the bursts are disappearing. By 6:41, the EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern. Despite the use of a Versed drip over the course of the night, intermittent rhythmic seizures are observed typically in the right central parietal region. The EEG also varies a bit in terms of a burst suppression pattern or a more continuous pattern but the seizures do occur out of the burst suppression pattern. The Versed is titrated up to a dose of 7 mg. By 4 a.m., the seizures are not sustained. At 7:56 a.m., the EEG is increasingly continuous. The well-defined seizures are not identified but bursts of activity are identified out of the right. There is a fair amount of variability in the background ranging from a more continuous pattern to a burst suppression pattern and then this ongoing highly epileptogenic pattern from the right hemisphere. From 11/25/2010 to 11/26/2010: The patient remains on a Versed drip. The video is not available. The overall background includes a relatively suppressed or intermittent burst suppression pattern. The well-defined seizures noted originally were not noted in this epoch of the record. At the end of this section of the record, bursts of activity up to 7 seconds with epileptiform activity in the right central and parietal regions are noted but the epileptiform activity is not as high amplitude as previously. Later sections on 11/25/2010, demonstrate a more continuous pattern with right occipital and parietal occipital spiking and polyspike activity. The record is quite variable with some sections clearly showing the same burst suppression pattern seen previously. No clinical seizures are noted and the seizure and spike detection identifies the burst suppression with parietal or posterior spikes but no sustained seizures. On 11/26/2010 to 11/27/2010: This section of the record demonstrates a pattern that is not always burst suppression. There are bursts of activity always with a spike in the right posterior region. There are no sustained or clinical or electrographic seizures, although when there are bursts of activity that are longer than 3 seconds in duration, it appears as if the patient is likely to seize. The seizure and spike detector captures the majority of the epileptiform activity. By 8:29 on 1112712010, the epileptiform activity is no longer occurring in bursts and it has transitioned to more of a periodic pattern. On 11/27/2010 to 11/28/2010: This section of the record demonstrates frequent occipital or occipital parietal spikes. The background ranges from a burst suppression pattern to more of a continuous low voltage theta pattern. On some occasions, the bursts of sharp waves appear in brief trains. HR: 120bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous EEG monitoring due to: 1. Electrographic seizures noted in the first 24 hours of the record from the central parietal and posterior temporal regions. 2. Burst suppression pattern. 3. Bursts of epileptiform activity in the right posterior quadrant. 4. Some periodic sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the right posterior quadrant. Although no additional seizures were recorded, if the patient is still receiving a Versed or sedative hypnotic drip, that might explain the discontinuous pattern. If this patient is no longer receiving anesthetic levels of sedation, additional evaluation for global cerebral function is suggested.'"

The baseline was requested because the patient was comatose.  The team noted that she had reactive pupils and occasional involuntary movements or myoclonus in the left hand only. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The tracing begins at 10:20 AM.  The patient is unresponsive and intubated.  In the video provided, there is no motor activity seen.  Ongoing epileptiform activity is seen with clear frequency evolution.  The activity includes generalized sharp and slow wave or spike and slow wave activity, which varies from 5 Hz to 1.5 Hz.

Postop day 1 on the 13th for bilateral bifrontal cranial debulking of subdural and epidural tumor. Frontal sinus surgery. Worsening neurologic function. MEDICATIONS:   Keppra, morphine, Lidocaine INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of  EKG. This is a Long Term Monitoring study. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is agitated and shaking from side to side throughout.

Long Term Monitoring- LTM -07-107 INTRODUCTION:   Continuous  video EEG monitoring is performed at bedside in the neurosurgical ICU. The patient is relatively quiet with a face mask. As the tracing opens, the high amplitude frontal delta is observed. This is remarkable in that it is maximum in the frontal region and there is an underlying sharp wave in the right frontal region.   There are no push buttons to indicate a seizure. There are no clinical reports of seizures.  The epileptiform activity and the rhythmic frontal delta is most prominent in the initial sections of this record. The patient waxes and wanes.  By the afternoon, he was off the face mask and is somewhat interactive with his family.  This is observed at 13:13. DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  The EEG continues to demonstrate bifrontal rhythmic delta with sharp waves most of which area in the right frontal region but with some variability in terms of F4. Arrhythmic delta is seen in the bifrontal regions. A number of the sharp waves spread to the left frontal region and FAFP2. Over the course of the last section of the record, after midnight on the morning of the 16th, there is an increase in theta frequency activity. There is some single tonal artifact at T5. The record concludes a 8 a.m. and at that time, the background includes a pattern of theta. HR:  96 bpm LONG TERM MONITORING:   November 14, 2007 to November 15, 2007. Introduction: Continuous  video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside in the ICU. A single seizure was reported by the team. This event is not marked. Description of report: This section begins on the 14th at 10:37 a.m. and concludes a 8:32 on the 15th. The seizure detections are reviewed. The initial portion of the record demonstrates frontal rhythmic delta with a sharp wave mixed in. That sharp wave is present bilaterally in the right or left frontal region. The family is present during this time. No clinical signs or symptoms are observed. Despite a great deal of artifact, the areas in question with continuous rhythmic delta and sharp waves at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.  No one is at the bedside and this activity is abating at 12:02 on the morning of the 14th. After this, the patient is seen to be a little bit more active. Intermittently, in this 24 hour, there is bifrontal delta with a sharp wave in the frontal regions identified with a bit more fast activity and FP1 region with clear bilateral representation  in terms of right and left frontal regions. This activity waxes and wanes and at 12:32, it is clearly more prominent on the left than the right, but overall discharge is 1 at the midline. Unfortunately, some of the electrodes are not functional. Overnight recording: There are problems with loss of electrode artifact and frequent bifrontal sharp waves in this case, left more prominent than right. By the end of this section, the epileptiform activity is fading and the background is one of theta with bifrontal delta. IMPRESSION:  This 48 hour long term EEG monitoring as remarkable for: 1. \\tFrontal delta. 2. \\tEpileptiform activity most apparent in the right frontal region with a bifrontal or left sided predominance by the close of the record. CLINICAL CORRELATION:   A well defined seizure was reported by the technologist, but is difficult to identify. There is rhythmic ictal activity with delta and sharp waves but there is no indication by an observer that there are clinical correlates and unfortunately, the camera is not in front of the and testing is not performed. Fortunately, by the close of the recording, the overall pattern is improving.'"

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. As the tracing begins, the patient has a facemask on and has difficulty cooperating.  The technologist notes that the patient had a seizure just prior to the beginning of the EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record demonstrate a very slow background, almost featureless, with frontally predominant slow 1 to 2 Hz delta activity, some muscle artifact, and some beta.   Stimulation of the patient produces some theta frequency activity.  The EEG is recorded in two pieces.  The first EEG is 15 minutes and the second EEG has a total recording time of approximately one hour.  The second piece begins at 9:53:22.  In this section of the record, there is a bit more theta and a bit more beta seen in the background.  The background isnâ\\x80\\x99t quite as featureless.  A seizure is identified at 10:05, which is characterized by rhythmic fast activity picked up in the right frontotemporal region with 5 Hz activity superimposed in the right frontocentral region.  It is initially very focal in the first five seconds, but is clearly spreading to the left after the first five seconds.  There is clear frequency evolution with increasing intensity of theta frequency activity, and an increase in the amplitude of the background seen at 10:06:01. Clinically, the patient is on a facemask, and appears to be looking at the video and appears to be agitated.  However, upon reviewing the video, the clinical correlates are initially difficult and then there seems to be more of a clonic jerking at 10:06:21.  The seizure demonstrates a rapid rate for tonic-clonic activity, but with a characteristic muscle artifact.  At 10:06:41, the activity is slowing.  At 10:06:46, again this activity is clearly slowing, and the seizure starts to abate at 10:06:51.  At that time, the jerking stops, but the ictal pattern continues until 10:06:57 with a dramatic background suppression.  The technologist notifies the house officer at that time.  The EEG is markedly suppressed in the postictal recording, but there is some muscle artifact and fast activity. The patient is given Fentanyl at 10:25:56.  The patient is mumbling despite a very slow background at 10:09. HR:  __ BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Marked background slowing, which starts to improve just prior to the patientâ\\x80\\x99s seizure at 10:05. The seizure lasts just over a minute, which seems to have a right frontal onset. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of an underlying epileptic disorder with seizures on this EEG localizing to the right frontal region.'"

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 9-year-old girl with staring spells, sleep walking, and impaired attention. Foster child born to mother with a question of drug abuse history. MEDICATIONS: None. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 50 to 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  Age appropriate quantities of background theta are identified.  Early on in the record, there is a burst of approximately 3 Hz delta from the left hemisphere, particularly the left temporal region.  The burst almost seems to be an artifact, but it is followed by a 15-second burst of frontally predominant, generalized high amplitude 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  This burst is accompanied by a behavioral change.  The child had been resting comfortably.   She opens her eyes almost as if she is startled, with a quick jerk.  In addition, she has involuntary movements for the photic stimulator.  Afterwards, the behavior doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to have been recognized by her caregiver as a seizure.  As she becomes drowsy, there is a very small discrete sharp wave seen five seconds later with another burst of this high amplitude left frontotemporal 3 to 4 Hz activity; again the burst is less than two seconds in duration.  Approximately five seconds later, there is another burst of high amplitude 3 to 4 Hz activity from the right hemisphere, similar to the one that appeared to be an artifact on the left.  This starts out as a high amplitude burst of delta, almost with a double phase reversal, and then there seems to be superimposed upon this some fact activity after 1.5 seconds.  A few seconds later, an additional burst is seen on the left lasting approximately two seconds, again with a suggestion of a poly spike component from the frontal regions and then multiple brief bursts from the left, some of which include a left frontotemporal or anterior temporal spike, which is a different localization than that seen initially. The second seizure in this EEG occurs at 11:52:40.  The child is resting quietly. She has a burst of the high amplitude 3 to 4 Hz activity, and this burst seems to begin on the left, but is bilateral.  Approximately .75 seconds into the burst, there is a frontal spike and slow wave complex that can be seen in both hemispheres, but the delta seems to begin from there and then the characteristic 3.4 Hz spike and slow wave activity is identified.  She opens her eyes at 11:52:47 early on in the seizure.  She looks upwards and she reaches her hands out.  The tech tells her to close her eyes and she appears to be confused.  The tech asks her a question and, in fact, the patient is able to provide an answer.  The patient says â\\x80\\x9calrightâ\\x80\\x9d when asked to close her eyes, and she is able to provide this answer within nearly two seconds at the end of the seizure.  She drifts off to sleep.  Her answer is inappropriate, but she is able to provide some information immediately after the seizure. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. HR:  95 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Electrographic seizures. Unusual epileptiform activity with both high amplitude generalized features and focal features. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The high amplitude, 3 to 5 Hz spike and slow wave activity with staring suggests an absence seizure, but in each case this activity was preceded by more clearly focal activity.  In addition, there is unusual focal activity identified from either hemisphere, but the focal activity from either hemisphere seems to be symmetric. There are isolated frontal spike and slow wave discharges that can be seen in inherited epilepsy, but there are also some that seem to be a bit more temporal.  The differential diagnosis for this pattern includes an unusual manifestation of an inherited epilepsy with perhaps some explanation for why some hemispheres differ in terms of their representation of the epileptiform activity versus a localization-related mechanism or a multifocal process.  Correlation with this childâ\\x80\\x99s neurologic examination and imaging is recommended.'"

      "text/plain": "' CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 16-month-old with new gait disorder and refractory seizures characterized by unilateral shaking. MEDICATIONS: Acyclovir, Ceftriaxone, Keppra 500 mg, Pentobarbital 65 mg, Phenobarbital, and previous Ativan. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the neonatal ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The child is intubated and this is a bedside recording.  There are no clinical notes regarding the patientâ\\x80\\x99s clinical condition or a description of seizures, and none are entered into the document. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This continuous video EEG monitoring begins at 15:50.  The background EEG includes a mixed frequency pattern with a bit more arrhythmic delta in the posterior regions.  There is a high amplitude spike and slow wave complex from the left hemisphere, maximum in the occipital regions, but with a generous field of spread.  In addition, there are occasional spike and slow wave complexes picked up in the right hemisphere, again with a generous field of spread in the centrotemporal regions with variable maximum.  There are no push button events to indicate that the clinical team identified seizures. At 23:42, there are bursts of frontal delta.  The record from 1500 to 2300 hours shows increasing amounts of beta.  The spiking continues.  The child is seen on the video.  He is lying supine, flaccid, and motionless. Pentobarbital 65 mg is given at midnight, producing frontal delta, and increasing amounts of Pentobarbital are given at 1:00 AM, 2:00 AM, and 9:00 AM, as well as 3:00 AM.  The recording continues to demonstrate a delta pattern with generous amounts of beta.  After midnight, when the child receives the Pentobarb, the epileptiform activity decreases substantially. Looking through the Stellate detection files, there is an event at 01:54.  This demonstrates an increasingly discontinuous pattern with flattening and then there is a burst of fast activity, which is most intense at the midline and on the right.  There are no clinical correlates noted with this burst.  Around this time, occasional discrete spike and spike and slow waves or sharp waves are noted from the right central region and the left occipital region. The next Stellate detection is at 3:41 and demonstrates intermittent bursts of fast activity from the central regions, left or right, in a background almost in burst suppression but not quite.  There are intermittent bursts of cerebral activity, as well as occasional focal spikes from the right central or left occipital region.  No clinical signs or symptoms accompany this Stellate detection. Intermittent recording from 1:00 AM through the next morning includes the Stellate detections at 3:41, 3:59, 4:02, 4:05, 4:22, and 4:35.  These patterns are similar to the entire pattern, which is one of almost a discontinuous-type pattern with a burst of approximately three seconds of fast activity, which is maximum in the central regions, sometimes a bit more on the left and sometimes on the right.  This is followed by a burst of mixed frequency, chaotic cerebral activity, sometimes with a sharp wave and sometimes followed by an attenuation.  The attenuation or suppression may be asymmetric, and may be depressed on the right or left side.  In addition, the bursts of fast activity typically precede the bursts of cerebral activity, but on occasion follow it.  The typical duration is approximately three seconds.  By 5:21 AM, the EEG demonstrates a more continuous pattern with frontal delta.  Again, no clinical signs are noted and the pattern at this time demonstrates less in the way of epileptiform activity.  It is difficult to correlate this with the infusion of the barbiturates, as the child is receiving Phenobarbital and Pentobarbital at the same time.  However, the child would have received 100 mg of Phenobarbital at 5:00 AM and there is a brief hiatus at that time with the Pentobarb.  At 7:48, the EEG becomes more discontinuous.  This would follow the administration of the Pentobarb, which at that point has increased from 0.65 ml/hr to 0.78 ml/hr.  No clinical signs or symptoms can be seen on the video, but there is a clear discontinuous pattern with a beta buzz from the left or right frontocentral regions. Long-Term EEG Monitoring â\\x80\\x93 February 7, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Acyclovir, Pentobarbital, and Phenobarbital.  The Pentobarbital drip starts at 0.78 ml/hr to 1.04 ml/hr. INTRODUCTION: The nursesâ\\x80\\x99 observations indicate that at 8:00 AM, there was an episode with left arm and left eye twitching and the patient received 65 mg of Pentobarbital bolus.  It is not possible to see the eye twitching or the examination of the patient during the seizure on the video. The next recorded seizure is at 2:00 PM on the 7th. EVENT TIME 13:54: The background EEG is markedly suppressed.  It is nearly featureless.  The childâ\\x80\\x99s father is at the bedside.  When there is cerebral activity, it is sharply contoured and the occasional right central sharp wave is seen in the background.  There is the intermittent three-second burst of beta identified from the right hemisphere, again lasting approximately three seconds.  At this point in time, the same burst of fast activity is seen, but it slowed to approximately alpha frequency at 10 Hz.  It is not possible to see if there is a clinical correlate with this.  Additional bursts are seen at 13:58 with two bursts in close approximation.  Extended video is reviewed at 2:00 AM.  There is a parent at the bedside who does not appear to observe any change in the childâ\\x80\\x99s behavior, and nothing is noted on the video. In the hours that follow, there are intermittent bursts lasting approximately a few seconds in duration of what is now alpha frequency activity most intense in the right hemisphere.  There are intermittent spike and slow wave complexes from the left occipital region and in the right hemisphere, particularly the centrotemporal region with a generous field of spread.  The bursts of beta disrupt the overall suppressed pattern. The nurses indicate that the Pentobarb dose varies between 1.04 ml/hr at 9:30 AM to 0.39 ml/hr at 4:00 PM.  In this section of the record, there doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to be a substantial change in terms of the background, which demonstrates an intermittently discontinuous pattern and the three-second periods of beta frequency activity. The Pentobarbital continues at a rate of 0.78 ml/hr (3 mg/kg/hr).  At the close of the record, the child does appear to be comatose, but the bursts of fast activity are seen in this context. HR:  150 to 180 BPM. Long-Term EEG Monitoring â\\x80\\x93 February 8, 2006 to February 9, 2006 INTRODUCTION: This section of the record runs from 8:42 to 13:25.  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the neonatal ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The child is currently in a Pentobarb coma with high dose Phenobarbital.  He is intubated and comatose.  Review of the video does not identify a clinical correlate. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is at times discontinuous and at other times very low voltage.  In this low voltage, suppressed background, there are intermittent spike and slow wave complexes identified from either hemisphere including the left occipital or right centrotemporal. There are intermittent bursts of fast activity.  These are identical to the previously described bursts of beta frequency activity, but are now primarily alpha frequency activity, lasting typically three seconds in duration.  These appear with three different patterns.  The first pattern is that seen in the previous epochs with a burst of fast activity either from both hemispheres or from one hemisphere or the other followed by arrhythmic delta.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of activity, which can be seen in one hemisphere with a transition to the other hemisphere, and the bursts of delta may precede or follow the burst of fast activity.  There are also some bursts with more of a bilateral representation.  They are followed by the chaotic delta and in some occasions there is some spiking picked up in the left hemisphere before the event is maximum on the left.  With the use of a sensitivity of 3 uV per minute, the EEG does appear to be less continuous with rhythmic slowing and frequent epileptiform discharges.  There is some variability in the degree of suppression and the frequency of the bursts of fact activity, but there is no sustained period longer than several minutes without these likely epileptiform discharges. Long-Term EEG Monitoring â\\x80\\x93 February 8, 2006 to February 9, 2006 Continued INTRODUCTION: During this section of the record, the observation was that the child was comatose.  There are no reports of twitching in this portion of the record. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG starts at 1400 hours.  In place of the previously described bursts of beta and alpha frequency activity, there are bursts of rhythmic activity, which are monomorphic, in the range of 7 to 10 Hz, lasting three and at times 10 seconds.  These gradually decrease and are less apparent by 1:00 AM.  In the 1:00 AM record that follows, there are frequent high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes in a very irritative brain, but there are no discernable clinical seizures and there are no additional bursts of that rhythmic monomorphic activity that was initially beta then slowing to alpha. This section of the record concludes at 10:30 AM on the morning of the 9th.  The pattern at the conclusion includes bursts of high amplitude, spike and slow wave activity from the right hemisphere particularly the centrotemporal region and the left occipital.  It is intermittently discontinuous with an irritative-looking pattern, but there are no sustained bursts of that rhythmic activity seen previously. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, February 9, 2006 to February 10, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Ceftriaxone, Phenytoin, and Midazolam.  Starting at 1:00 PM Phenobarbital. INTRODUCTION: This continuous video EEG monitoring begins at 11:00 AM and continues to the morning of the 10th.  During this section, the patient received Phenytoin in the morning and was started on a Versed drip at .5 mg/kg/hr. One clinical event characterized by eye flutter was reported at 2200 hours, but could not be identified subsequently. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the early portions of the record, the background EEG demonstrates a pattern, which is intermittently suppressed with occasional sharp waves from the left occipital and right centrotemporal regions.  There is some variability in the record with some portions of the record more suppressed than others.  There are also bursts of sharply contoured activity. The Versed is started at 2:00 PM.  This is associated with an attenuation of the background.  There is a decrease in the sharp waves noted in the background and no clinical seizures were recorded.  At the close of the record, the EEG is low voltage, not entirely discontinuous, with a marked decrease in the fast activity. During this section of the record, none of the patientâ\\x80\\x99s bursts of fast activity were identified. HR: 122 BPM. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, February 10, 2006 to February 11, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Midazolam with doses ranging from 0.5 to 0.2, Phenobarbital, and others. INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The medication printout does not tag all of the medication changes, but at 13:18, the Versed was decreased to 0.3 mg/kg/hr.  The patient remains intubated and poorly responsive. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial background, there is a mixed frequency pattern.  The pattern includes arrhythmic slow delta and smaller amounts of theta.  In the initial portions of the record, there is some subtle variability with stimuli.  There is also a bit of asymmetry with a bit more faster frequency activity on the right. Over the course of time, the Versed dose is reduced to 2 mg/hr at 16:28:53.  It is reduced again at 18:27:29.  It isnâ\\x80\\x99t until after midnight on the morning of the 11th that the spiking really increases and there is an increase in epileptiform activity in the left occipital region. By the close of the recording on the morning of the 11th, the EEG is continuous. There is a left occipital spike seen and some EKG artifact.  The overall background is rich in delta with some alpha and theta frequency activity and some fast activity. A clinical seizure was reported at 10:00 AM, which is not included in this piece of the recording, which ended at 9:23. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, February 11, 2006 to February 12, 2006 INTRODUCTION: In this portion of the record, the child is heavily sedated.  The record starts on the morning of the 11th.  At that time, the Versed drip had been increased to .2 because of clinical events. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the EEG is remarkable for frequent left occipital spiking.  It is unique in that there is more fast activity from the right posterior region, and this is the first time that a right posterior temporal sharp wave has been identified.  The record is variable with portions of the record demonstrating more delta than others.  This section is remarkable for few comments, although there were later reports that this child had clinical events during this section of the record.  As the recording continues at 14:39, there is more fast activity and a bit more asymmetry with a bit less delta from the right.  On the morning of the 11th, there is an event described by the nurse as a seizure.  The tech makes a comment at 10:10 AM.  The video is reviewed, which shows the nurse at the bedside.  The video failed to identify any EEG changes that would be referable to this and the child does not seem to be moving.  The childâ\\x80\\x99s face is not well defined, but there isnâ\\x80\\x99t any arm movement. Right hand circular movements at 11:00 AM on the 11th were not visualized by the video and there was no EEG correlate. By 11:00 PM on the 11th, the background is more symmetric, richer in faster frequency activity.  Right arm movement of the child is noted at midnight, although there is an individual at the bedside.  The child is being suctioned, which might account for the movement.  The nurses had observed that the behaviors that they were calling seizures were stimulus sensitive.  The EEG record on the morning of the 12th demonstrates a pattern rich in faster frequency activity, as well as theta.  There are frequent spike and slow wave complexes, left occipital, right posterior temporal, and fewer in the right central region.  There are no definite bursts of alpha and beta frequency activity. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, February 12, 2006 to February 13, 2006 MEDICATIONS: Ceftriaxone, Phenytoin, Fentanyl, Midazolam, and Phenobarbital.  Vecuronium is given at 10:19:46. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG in this portion of the record is continuous, rich in theta and delta frequency activity with fast activity.  In this section of the record, there is epileptiform activity including right occipital or right posterior temporal, as well as left, but there are few of the bursts of fast activity.  Although there were reports that the child had seizures on this day, they are not marked in the EEG and in that the behaviors were not associated with a change in the EEG, it is not possible to identify them, even with the video camera.  As the recording continues, it is not clear when the dose of Versed was increased.  There is some twitching seen at 20:38, and the nurses are working at the bedside at 20:41.  By 22:54, the bursts of fast activity have returned, lasting now approximately two seconds, not so clearly associated or followed with delta.  These are relatively synchronous in both hemispheres are this time.  There are no clinical notes regarding whether or not these were considered significant, but by midnight, it appears that the Versed drip may have been increased as the background is slower than previously identified and is sometimes discontinuous.  By 2:00 AM, the EEG is increasingly continuous, however, there are also focal spikes and the bursts of the fact activity are seen in what is now a somewhat continuous record.  This would also be considered a new pattern for this child. At 10:38 infusion with Dilantin is given to the patient. Right hand movements are noted by the nurse at 18:36:27.  This was somewhat difficult to discern on the video, but no EEG correlate. Right hand and arm movements were noted on the 12th at 8:27 and 9:38, with more pronounced motor activity and a more sustained seizure.  Again, this was without clear correlate, however, in this case, it is quite possible that there was an underlying ictal discharge not otherwise seen.  Ditto 9:45. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, February 13, 2006 to February 14, 2006 DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG on the morning of the 13th, continues to show the discontinuous pattern with fast activity.  Also, there is a fine tremor of the right hand.  The EEG revealed no clear EEG correlate, but muscle artifact, which is sustained and may very well have an underlying ictal pattern not well visualized by scalp EEG.  Ditto 7:43:52 and 8:21. There is a clinical seizure that occurs at 12:20:05 after the nurse moves the patient.  This can be reviewed on the video.  The review begins at 2:18.  At that time, the EEG shows a somewhat discontinuous pattern with beta bursts and occipital spiking.  The nurse enters at 12:20:00.  She starts by touching the child on the left at 12:20:10.  As she is touching the patient at 12:20:11, the EEG changes from what is a higher amplitude pattern with mixed delta and theta and the intermittent bursts of beta.  There is an attenuation in frequency and it looks like there is fast activity out of the right hemisphere.  Immediately as she starts touching him, the right arm starts moving in an almost circular fashion â\\x80\\x93 almost a semi-purposeful fashion.  The nurse notes that the child is turning to the right.  There is some frontal delta and some spiking in the occipital regions bilaterally.  The EEG seems to change for the third time in this seizure at 20:20:41 with more muscle artifact.  The circular movements are noted with the right hand and there is another movement in the left hand.  The right arm is down and the left hand is more flexed and extended, not entirely like a fenster posturing but with that suggestion.  During this time, the EEG doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have a clear ictal pattern.  There may be some underlying spiking in the left posterior temporal region. SEIZURE TIME 12:20: On Monday, February 13th, the motor activity continues as long as the child has tactile stimulation.  At 12:31, there is what may be artifact, but may also be part of this childâ\\x80\\x99s unusual epileptiform appearance out of the right hemisphere with a combination of fast activity and muscle artifact. By 16:57, the EEG has returned to its usual pattern with bursts of beta activity and the occipital spike with less in the way of the right occipital spike or the other epileptiform features.  There are other portions of the record where muscle artifact is seen including 19:57.  This is a long event and seems to start with handling of the patient.  It begins with circular movements of the right hand, muscle artifact on the right, and right eye deviation.  The occipital spiking is not seen at that time.  There is somewhat of an increase in faster frequency activity in the overall background, but there is no clear ictal pattern.  At 19:59:19, the nurses are handling the patient during the seizure and the arm continues to move. Dilantin infusion. Long-Term EEG Monitoring, February 14, 2006 to February 15, 2006 INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at the bedside.  In this section of the record, no clinical seizures are noted.  The patient is on a Versed drip of 6. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record begins, the background is continuous with a mixed frequency pattern. At 12:51:21, epileptiform activity is apparent in a background that is slower than the initial morning recording.  In addition, as the recording continues over the course of the 14th, there are occasional bursts of fast activity occurring with bursts now under three seconds, more typically on the order of two seconds, maximum at the midline with some occasional predisposition to the right or the left side is seen.  These no longer seem to be associated with the same bursts of delta that were previously identified.  This section of the record is recorded in two pieces.  The first piece concludes at 16:21, and at that time, left, quick bursts of fast activity are seen, but the left occipital spiking is noted.  Again, no clinical correlates are noted. The additional section of the recording continues to show a child who is unresponsive.  The late afternoon and overnight recording again shows relatively frequent left occipital spike and wave complexes, as well as the occasional bursts of fast activity.  At times, the record is somewhat discontinuous and in other portions of the record, the record is richer in mixed beta and delta, but at some points when it is relatively rich in this activity, there is both frequent left occipital spiking and the bursts of beta. HR:  120 BPM. IMPRESSION: This prolonged video EEG monitoring is remarkable for: An unusual form of status epilepticus with what appeared to be clinically, sometimes on the video and sometimes by eye witnessed accounts, an unusual seizure which at times was stimulus sensitive, at times marked, and at other times more subtle with circular movements of the right hand or clonic movements of the right side of the body.  It was almost a fenster posture of the left hand and/or elevation of the left leg.  These activities were sometimes associated with eye flutter. After the administration of benzodiazepines or barbiturates, bursts of fast activity were seen, which seemed to be ictal in nature, preceded or followed by bursts of delta. Epileptiform foci left occipital, right central, and as the recording continued, right posterior temporal. CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is supportive of a very marked underlying epileptiform disorder.  The behaviors without clear clinical correlates do appear to be seizures, particularly as some subtle behaviors seem to have an underlying change in the EEG.  Of note, this activity responded early on to Versed or to high dose barbiturates, but then seemed to breakthrough.'"

MEDICATIONS: Tylenol, Phenobarbital, Vancomycin, and Depakote. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal with a mixture of rhythmic theta and shifting arrhythmic delta.  The activity is sharply contoured.   There are bursts of rhythmic frontal delta and bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta, some of which are more remarkable from the right compared to the left with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere and a bit more sharply contoured activity in the right central region, but without definitive spike and slow wave complexes.  Apparent vertex waves are identified, although it is not entirely clear what the patientâ\\x80\\x99s sleep state is.  The technologist avoids stimulating the patient as that seems to elicit some of her agitation.  When the video is reviewed, the portions of the record with the vertex activity demonstrates a relatively quiet individual, but without testing, it is impossible to know whether or not the patient is in fact asleep.  She is noted to have spontaneous movements of the left hand and sits with the left hand somewhat clenched. HR:  90 BPM. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Generalized background slowing with a mixture of rhythmic theta and arrhythmic delta. Shifting arrhythmic delta sometimes more prominent in the right hemisphere. Bursts of generalized frontal delta. Concerning, pathological vertex waves noted for this individual. CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were seen.  In comparison to previous studies, the epileptiform activity previously identified, which was quite prominent, has resolved substantially.

INTRODUCTION: This is a 35-minute digital video EEG, performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is examined during the EEG. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG begins with a medium-to-high amplitude pattern with rhythmic paroxysmal activity.  There seems to be an artifact with some muscle activity, but there also seems to be a bifrontal spike and slow wave complex, which is high in amplitude.  Examination of the patient fails to identify a clinical correlate with this movement.  The patient is examined in detail.  While she does seem to have some element of stimulus-induced ocular myoclonus, the EEG pattern does not seem to have a relationship to the patientâ\\x80\\x99s motor activity and does seem to wax and wane.  It is typically in the theta frequency range, but slows to delta and then builds up again.  There is sometimes a poly spike component and it is on occasion faster, reaching up to a 7 to 8 Hz spike and slow wave complex.  The activity is bilateral, poorly localized.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient is in a wheelchair with a trache, but she appears clinically to be somnolent but she does open and close her eyes. DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow, but there does appear to be a posterior dominant rhythm.  The major features in this record are a generalized spike and slow wave complex with an unusual field of spread. It is approximately 2.7 to 3Hz, at this point picked up in the frontal and parietal regions.  Using a transverse montage, it seems to be maximum at the vertex.  Looking at the video, there doesn't seem to be a clinical correlate for these spikes.  The patient does seem to demonstrate a sleep state with vertex waves, but the 2.5 to 3 Hz vertex spike can be seen with and without this activity.  Photic stimulation is performed without an attempt to awaken the patient, however, there is  a questionable driving response. Vigorous stimulation of the patient is not performed. HR:  84BPM. IMPRESSION:  Abnom1al EEG due to: 1.   Persistence of a vertex and generalized spike and wave activity. 2.   Generalized background slowing.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is very confused during the test. As the tracing begins, the patient is at the bedside. He is staring off into space. He uses his right hand, but never moves his left. The patient is somewhat responsive. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG starts out somewhat poorly organized with generous beta. In addition, the overall background includes theta and alpha frequency activity. There are some frontal temporal sharp waves noted at F4 C4 initially. There is arrhythmic noncontinuous delta beginning to emerge at 12:15. This becomes increasingly rhythmic at 12:16. This wanes on its own, but when it recurs during the EEG the patient lifts up his right hand and seems to have difficulty putting down the right hand. The technologist moves the patient around a bit and at 12:26 the activity seems to be fading. In addition to some artifact there is a question of T6 sharp waves. The second seizure is observed in the EEG at 12:21, but there is little in the way of a clinical correlate aside from a confused patient. The technologist notes that the patient is not able to follow commands such as keeping his eyes closed, but there is clearly a rhythmic ictal discharge lasting approximately 2 seconds with postictal slowing and then spikes which can be T2, T4, C4. The second seizure as it fades seems to generate into a third seizure at 12:26. Again, the rhythmic theta frequency activity waxes and wanes. With the second seizure it does not seem to be ending. It is ongoing at 12:30:20. Spikes start to appear more frequently in the seizures in comparison to the first sections of the record in which it was primarily a pattern of rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity. In addition to the right frontal central spikes there are also central temporal and anterior temporal spikes. The recording ends at 12:35 with initially 3 discreet seizures and then a pattern of a more continuous ictal activity. HR: 84 bpm IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intra-hemispheric asymmetry with a primarily 8 Hz activity on the right in wakefulness and a slower activity on the left with more attenuated activity on the left. In addition, sharp waves are observed on the left including F7 and T5. The most prominent focus of epileptiform activity is at T5 with low voltage , somewhat periodic sharp waves observed at T5. As the patient transitions into sleep, the epileptiform activity persists including F7, F1 and these relatively frequent low voltage T5 sharp waves. There are also a handful of sharp waves in the transition to sleep on the right at C4. Intermittent arousals to and from sleep are observed. In the transition to sleep, there are even some sharp waves observed at 01. Photic stimulation: Photic stimulation elicits asymmetric driving, better developed on the right.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes continuous periodic high amplitude sharp waves in the right frontal region. There is initially more involvement in the left frontal region. Tactile stimulation of the patient seems to ameliorate some of the epileptiform activity and some it evolves into delta with tactile stimulation. Frequent eye movements are noted.

Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed. In this individual with cranial abnormalities, there is eye artifact in the left frontal region, but the eye artifacts are quite asymmetric suggesting asymmetric cranium as described by the technologist in her description of the patient's skull. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing opens, the patient is awake. There is symmetric eye movement  artifact. The overall record is relatively low voltage, relatively symmetric with a discernible alpha rhythm. The patient has multiple episodes during the EEG. There is a video EEG and the technologist repositions  the patient on camera, but it is still difficult to determine exactly what is happening during the spells. The patient has circular movements  of the head followed by head turning to the left. On the first event, there is characteristic  muscle artifact as can be seen in a tonic clonic seizure but not so much in the way of background slowing. In the 2nd event, which occurs at 11:49, there is again the same artifact but there is clear background slowing and right frontal sharp and slow wave activity observed at the close of this seizure. The 3rd seizure occurs at 11:58. It occurs just as the technologist has gotten ready to do photic stimulation. Again, at 11:58, the patient has some circular movements of the head. The EEG is obscured by muscle but there seems to be some underlying alpha frequency activity. The technologist observes that the patient is unresponsive. By 11:58:40, the technologist notes that the patient has some eye twitching. The EEG starts to have a slowing of the activity as is seen in the chronic phase of the seizure. The video is reviewed and the technologist is recording eye twitching but not much else is seen. The activity starts to slow at 11:58:57. There is an underlying right frontal sharp and slow wave complex observed with this activity. The activity is clear slowing in transitioning to a postictal phase at 11:59:14.

Photic simulation performed after the 3rd seizure, scant driving is observed. A 4th seizure occurs. This is again characterized  by the muscle artifact, head turning to the right, chewing and the right frontal sharp and slow activity. Total seizure duration is 1 minute 18 seconds. This last seizure is less remarkable than the others. HR:  78 bpm and irregular IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1.  4 complex partial seizures with variable duration, but most longer than 1 minute in duration. CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. These findings merit addition intervention and evaluation.\""

MEDICATIONS: \\tDilantin, Depakote, phenobarbital, insulin, digoxin, Lopressor. INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG is performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. During the record, including on the 26th, the Phenobarbital was turned off. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial data on the 24th there are intermittent seizures occurring in the contexts of burst suppression. There are prolonged periods of suppression with brief seizures. However, by 16:28 the EEG is completely suppressed. This section of the record was previously dictated. Additional recording after 16:37 for the following subsequent days includes the following: October 24 to October 25: A suppressed EEG. The patient can be visualized in the unit. Technologist and nurses work with her. The background EEG remains markedly suppressed. October 25 to October 26: Again no definite cerebral activity is observed. The overall activity is very low voltage. Electrode artifacts and other artifacts are observed. There is no variability in the record, although there is some EKG artifact. October 26 to October 27: Background EEG continues to demonstrate an essentially suppressed pattern. There is some artifact picked up in the background.

Study from 2253 on October 23, 2008 through October 24, 2008 at 1043. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Due to continuous right frontal sharp waves patient is put higher in a pentobarbital coma. There seems to be more bursts of right frontal sharp waves consistent with the status, but there are some seen as well on the left. Pentobarbital is started at 125. At that time an intermittent suppression pattern is seen. Periods of bursts will go from 30 seconds to 1 minute and 40 seconds. When there is a return of the burst the patient is seen to reenter a status pattern of right frontal greater than left sharp waves, which can last for 20 seconds before there is return of suppression. As the records continues you have longer periods of suppression, but as soon as the patient returns to a burst pattern, again you see the nonconvulsive status pattern of the right predominantly frontal discharges. On the right there is definitely extension of these discharges throughout the hemisphere. A heart rate 60 beats per minute. IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 1.\\tPharmacological burst suppression pattern. 2. Bursts of continuous sharp waves seen, right greater than left.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel in EKG.  The patient was poorly cooperative throughout the record.  Occasional muscle twitch artifact was noted. DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG was diffusely slow with a lower voltage beta and theta pattern.  The normal milestones of an awake adult EEG were not identified.\n\n CLINICAL HISTORY: MEDICATIONS: INTRODUCTION:  This is a continuation of the day 3 and 4 report on this patient for the dates 03/14/2012 to 03/16/2012. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Day 3:  At the onset of day 3, there is frequent rhythmic runs of sharp waves seen at F7, T1 and at times at T5 that appear to come and go but have no clear evolution.  However, on 03/15 in the morning at 9:30 a.m., the patient appears to suddenly stop talking on the phone, put herself on the side of her left chest and started rubbing her shirt with her right hand.  The nurses at the bedside started asking her questions, and she could not answer.  Then she started staring at the nurse and exhibiting mouth movements while she continued to rub her chest with her hand.  Afterwards, about 20 seconds later, she started rubbing her chest with her left hand and continued to __________with the left hand.  This continues until the seizure and the left hand movement stops seconds later, and then she just stares and remains unresponsive.  This behavior then stops as the seizure stops.  About 2 minutes and 40 seconds after the seizure, the behavior stops and the seizure ends.  During this time, the EEG reveals at about almost 50 seconds after the clinical onset of the seizure there appears to be an evolving T5 discharge which then appears to increase in frequency from 2 to 4 Hz to 6 Hz and moves more anteriorly, then slowing down before stopping at the end of the seizure.  End of day 3. Day 4:  During day 4, there are multiple nonconvulsive seizures.  The first one is seen at 6:30 p.m. lasting about 4 minutes where the patient is lying in bed and appears to exhibit no movements.  Meanwhile, there is a rhythmic discharge in the left anterior temporal region at F7-T1 that increases and slows down in rhythmicity but continues throughout the recording, at times with larger and smaller superimposed sharp waves.  The next nonconvulsive electrical seizure occurred at 11:31 p.m.  This one appears to begin at T5 and appears to slowly evolve and move more anteriorly to F7-T1.  During it, the patient appears to move but does not clearly appear to exhibit a clinical correlate.  The event ends about 1 minute and 50 seconds later.  End of seizures day 4. IMPRESSION:\n\n CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizures day 2. MEDICATIONS: INTRODUCTION:  On the recording there were 3 nonclinical seizures detected.  Incidentally, open review of the study the first one occurred at 1:27:42 p.m.  The patient laying in bed listening to the phone and there was no clinical correlate.  There is nice rhythmic delta proceeding to theta of 71 discharge which appears to increase in frequency and end in about 30 seconds.  At 1:30:52 p.m. another similar electrocardiographic seizure occurs for about 40 seconds.  However, the evolution of this one is not as nice as the first one.  At about 6:31 p.m. he has another rhythmic discharge which appears to start in the 2 Hz range, increasing to 5 Hz rhythmically at F7, T1 and again with no clinical correlate, the patient appears to be watching television during this last event.  No other events were recorded during the second 20 hours of day 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: IMPRESSION:  The rest of the impression and the correlation will be added at the end of this report.\n\n"
