CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 64-year-old male with meningioma, admitted with recurrent episodes with head turning to left and speech arrest with stiffening.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Versed, phenytoin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring begins in the ICU for this intubated patient at 3 a.m. on December 8th.  During EEG setup, the patient is experiencing clinical seizures with head turning and stiffening.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial EEG is compatible with electrographic status epilepticus with recurrent seizures from the right hemisphere with epileptiform activity including fast activity, theta activity, and build up of sharp waves and spikes.  The activity is nearly continuous, waxing and waning over the course of the recording.
The patient's hemodynamics status is stabilized in the initial hours of the recording and the patient's medications are titrated upwards.  The patient's EEG monitoring is briefly suspended when the patient is transferred to the neurosurgical ICU.
Over the course of the day, the patient's doses of midazolam are increased to a level of 8 and the patient's pressure support is stabilized.
By 10:47 p.m., frequent sharp waves and spikes with fast activity are noted, compatible with a late ictal/postictal pattern.
By the 24-hour mark, 3 a.m., the EEG activity is beginning to be more consistently fading with ongoing, periodic sharp waves, but without such prominent frequency evolution.  Fast activity is noted from hemisphere in the right central temporal region.  The patient is clinically somnolent with occasional muscle artifact.
Heart rate 100 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This first 24 hours of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Electrographic and clinical status epilepticus with head turning and stiffening.
A refractory pattern of epileptiform activity in the context of a patient with fragile cardiopulmonary status, but ultimately with stabilization with a higher dose of midazolam to a PLED+ pattern
Prominent breach rhythm from the right hemisphere with prominent fast activity.
