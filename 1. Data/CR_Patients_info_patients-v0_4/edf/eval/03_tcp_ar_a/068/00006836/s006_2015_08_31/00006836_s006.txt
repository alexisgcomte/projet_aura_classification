HISTORY:
a 26 YR OLD MALE P/W ALTERED MENTAL STATUS . AT BASELINE PT NOTED TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER YES/NO . NO WITNESS SZ.
PMHX :
PARAPLEGIA 2/2 GSW WITH TBI RECURRENT UTI
SZ D/O
CHRONIC HYPOTHERMIA VDRF
MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND :
that is disorganized and lacks the normal anterior to posterior gradient.
No normal sleep is seen.
The right fronto central (F4/F8) region reveals continuous focal slowing and attenuation.
There is nearly continuous focal slowing in the left central region (C3) .
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
The EEG revealed 4 electrographic seizures: The seizures commence with a crisp beta discharge at C4/Cz that evolve in frequency to alpha and have a concurrent increase in amplitude. They remain mainly over the right central region and last - 1 - 3.5 minutes.
There is no video correlate seen during the seizures. ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation and Photic Stimulation: Not performed.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
Right central electrographic status epilepticus .
Continuous focal slowing and attenuation in the right frontal region.
Nearly continuous focal slowing in the left central region .
Moderate diffuse slow.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a very abnormal routine EEG which reveals right central electrographic status epilepticus. There is additional continuous focal cerebral cortical dysfunction in the right frontal region, which is consistent with the known injury. There also nearly continuous focal cerebral dysfunction in the left central region, which has a high correlation with an structural lesion in that region. Lastly, there is evidence	diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is non-s		etiology.
