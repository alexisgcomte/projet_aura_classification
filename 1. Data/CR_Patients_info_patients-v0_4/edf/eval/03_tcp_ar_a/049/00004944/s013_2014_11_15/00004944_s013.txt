History:	52 year old man with a history of left frontoparietal GBM status post resection
several months ago, now presents with worsening right sided weakness and
ambulatory dysfunction.  Patient found to be in focal status epilepticus on a spot
Medications:	Dilantin, Depakote, Phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 11/14/2014 till 11/15/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  There is no
clear PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta
activity that are more pronounced over the left, with highest amount of delta activity present over
left posterior quadrant.  Additionally, there is underriding fast activity over the left posterior
quadrant (breach rhythm).  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  Waveforms similar to K-
Several electrographic seizures are noted.  Last seizure is noted at ~5:27 PM.  There is no clear
clinical correlate.  Seizures start with rhythmic moderate amplitude ~5-5.5 Hz spikes with aftergoing
slow waves emanating from T5 and O1 electrodes.  There is a gradual increase in frequency and
spread to the P3, C3 and Pz electrodes.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, moderate, left hemispheric, especially over the posterior quadrant
Seizure, occasional, left posterior, last seizure is captured at ~5:27 PM
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring due to moderate diffuse slowing,
more so over the left hemisphere and, especially, over the left posterior quadrant and occasional
focal left posterior quadrant electrographic seizures without clear clinical correlate.  Diffuse slowing
is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Increase
in the degree of slowing as the recording progresses is related to  increase in the doses/ addition of
CNS-active medications.There is focal structural epileptogenic lesion over the left - known left
frontoparietal tumor status post several resections.  When compared to the prior 24 hour recording complexes are present.epoch, in the last 24 hour the degree of diffuse slowing increased and seizure frequency decreased

significantly.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team and therapy was adjusted.
