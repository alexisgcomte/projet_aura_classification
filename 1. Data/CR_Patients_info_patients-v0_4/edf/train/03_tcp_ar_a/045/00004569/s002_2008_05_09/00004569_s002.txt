CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year-old man with refractory epilepsy.
Keppra, Namenda, Aricept, Simvastatin, Lisinopril, Asa Thiamine
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed at bedside using
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Continuous
seizure and spike detection software is utilized.
DESCRIPTION OR RECORD: The EEG continues to demonstrate recurrent
electrographic seizures, all of which emanate from the right hemisphere particularly the
central parietal region. They wax and wane. There are epochs without seizures but
even at the close of this record, there is electrographic seizure observed. In the portions
of the record without continuous ictal activity the patient is moving about. Interestingly,
he is talking during some of the seizures but during those discharges, he does not seem
to be moving his left hand. His left leg is outside of the camera. On one occasion when
he is sitting my himself he has a seizure, he is talking, but he has eye deviation to the
HR:: N/A.
Abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring due to:
1. Ongoing complex and simple partial seizures from the left hemisphere some of
which have no clinical correlate and some of which have a subtle clinical correlate.
CLINICAL These findings are similar to previous EEGs.
