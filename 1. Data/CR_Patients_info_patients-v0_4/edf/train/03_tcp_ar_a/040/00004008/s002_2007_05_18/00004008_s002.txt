CLINICAL HISTORY: 	Sixty-one-year-old  right-handed male, bladder cancer with frontal hemorrhage and complex partial seizures characterized by staring and impaired responsiveness, ?   tonic-clonic seizure at some point.
MEDICATIONS: 	Dilantin, Xanax, levetiracetam, others.
INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient had 2 clinical seizures during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	As the tracing opens, the patient is awake. The technologist notes briefly that he is poorly responsive.
She also observes eye fluttering. Frontally predominant delta activity
is identified in association with this behavior. This activity is more remarkable on the left compared to the right. Afterwards, the activity is a bit slow. At 11:29 during this EEG there is a little bit more theta but without clear evolution at that time. It must be noted, however, that when the technologist tells the patient to close his
eyes he does not do it and he continues to move around and blink. For the 11:29 event, the patient knocks off one of his EEG electrodes and then lies back. The technologist does not seem to have observed that change. The EEG during the second event was just a bit more prolonged. It was primarily remarkable for higher amplitude 3-4 hertz activity from the right hemisphere with some bifrontal representation. The patient is also a bit more confused during this event. By 11:37 the
EEG has return to a less remarkable, more normal-appearing background, although there is delta identified from the right hemisphere, particularly frontal central/frontotemporal.

HR: 75 BPM.
IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to 2 seizures characterized by frontal delta with confusion.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 	This EEG is diagnostic of a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. The seizures were clinically apparent but not easily identified by the bedside technologist.
