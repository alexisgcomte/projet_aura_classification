CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old woman with schizophrenia and glioblastoma
multiforme, craniotomy, receiving radiation therapy. Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Klonopin, Risperdal, Depakote, Keppra, Doxepin, Norvasc, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow. There is a breech rhythm identified in the left frontocentral region with significant deformity observed at CZ/C3. In addition, there is arrhythmic delta at C3 but also an awake, C3/CZ sharp wave. This is relatively periodic and when the patient is resting comfortably. This EEG demonstrates background with diffuse theta. There is a breech rhythm in the left central region. Two seizures are observed and are associated with rhythmic jerking of the right hand. The seizures are approximately 2 seconds in duration. Following the seizures, intermittent, left central sharp waves are observed. Breech rhythm in a little bit of a skull deformity is observed in the central parietal region.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Two 2-minute seizures out of the left central region.
2. Left periodic sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural frontal abnormality on the left and is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for seizures.
