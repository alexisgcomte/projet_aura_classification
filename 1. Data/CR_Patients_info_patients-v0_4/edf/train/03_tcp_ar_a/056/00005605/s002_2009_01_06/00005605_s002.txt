CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old woman with subdural hematoma after MVA, change in mental status, facial droop, left leg weakness, craniotomy now with multiple seizures characterized by right facial twitching, ipsilateral to the subdural hematoma.



MEDICATIONS: None listed in chart



INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and a sleep record.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an

interhemispheric asymmetry. There is a theta pattern observed on the left with some frontocentral delta. The right hemisphere demonstrates attenuation on the right, compatible with a fluid collection. There also appears to be a burr hole artifact in the left frontal region and some sharply contoured activity in that region: Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal. Left frontal sharp waves are observed.



HR: 60 bpm.



IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

1. Background slowing.

2. Interhemispheric asymmetry with relative attenuation on the right compared to the left.

3. Beta asymmetry, again with attenuation on the right.

4. Left frontotemporal sharp waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features described above are characteristic of a subdural hematoma. The left-sided sharp waves may be relevant to the focal facial twitching.
