CLINICAL HISTORY: 	48-year-old male with epilepsy for the past
27 years. Complex partial and tonic clonic seizures occurring 5-
6 times per month. Status post long term monitoring.
MEDICATIONS: 	Phenobarbital, Gabitril, Tegretol
INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hertz,
40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of excess background theta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and seems to accentuate left temporal sharp waves as well as focal slowing. There are also right temporal sharp waves observed. Maximum in T2 area with the end of hyperventilation.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy, the left temporal features are somewhat more notable with anterior temporal sharp waves and associated focal slowing. EKG artifact is also picked up in mid T1, T3 electrodes. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: 	Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relatively and frequent anterior temporal sharp waves seen independently from the right or the left, most prominently seen in hyperventilation in this record.
2. Occasional associated focal slowing, particularly from the
left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to previous EEGs, the epileptiform activity was relatively subtle today. In addition, there was a strong unilateral presence predominant in this EEG.
Paper copies of the previous EEGs were not available for more specific comparison at the time of dictation.
