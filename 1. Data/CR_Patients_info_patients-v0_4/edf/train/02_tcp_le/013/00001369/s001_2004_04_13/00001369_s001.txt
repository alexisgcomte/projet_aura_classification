CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 34-year-old female, previously admitted to Friendâ€™s Hospital, inn the ICU with significant burns and a seizure today.
MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, Ativan, Carafate, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and sedated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage and diffusely slow with primarily a mixed frequency pattern with slow delta, smaller amounts of theta and some alpha frequency activity.  There is a suggestion of a posterior dominant rhythm, although never well defined.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response with an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity, as well as eye opening.
HR:  116 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Replacement of normal background with a slow, low voltage pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The reactivity as well as the presence of alpha frequency activity are positive prognostic features. There were no epileptiform features identified.
