CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old male with lethargy, acute change in mental status, after long heart failure hospitalization,renal failure on hemodialysis, CHF, CAD, MI, hypertension, GERD, and diabetes.  Small left frontal subcortical hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, Synthroid, Insulin, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is unresponsive with a tracheostomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized and diffusely slow.  The normal posterior dominant alpha rhythm is not identified.  Instead, continuous frontally predominant triphasic-like activity as well as slow sharp and wave activity at 2 to 3 Hz was seen.  The slow sharp activity was mainly seen at the O1, O2 and PZ central areas.  The patient had some spontaneous movements such as a slight turning of the head or coughing, however, stimulation of the patient did not change the background nor was the patient responsive to stimuli
HR:  150 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous occipital epileptiform activity in an unresponsive adult
Disorganized and diffusely slow background.
Continuous triphasic-like activity and slow sharp activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The EEG findings are consistent with the subtle status epilepticus .  These results were discussed with the primary team.
