CLINICAL HISTORY: A 54-year-old right-handed woman with frontal lobe epilepsy, status post intracerebral hemorrhage. Prior seizure in 2003, previously treated with topiramate, Neurontin and other anticonvulsants. 	Now with a seizure today characterized by lips and
mouth swelling
MEDICATIONS: 	Topiramate, Neurontin, Allegra, others. INTRODUCTION:		Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using
standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. 	This
is an outpatient. 	Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness background EEG is low voltage with a 10.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. 	Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in theta. Drowsiness is characterized by slow, rolling eye movements. 	Vertex waves are observed in Stage 1-C. 	Vertex wave spindles and then arousals are observed in the Stage 2 sleep record. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: 	Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:	This record contrasts to previous studies which demonstrated  left/right temporal excess frontal theta. 	No
epileptiform features were seen, although some normal variants
were observed in that ongoing seizures are noted. 	Additional EEG
recording capturing one of her events may be advised.
