CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old woman with complex partial seizures now seizure-free for many years.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 11 Hz, 30 to 50 V with excess background theta activity.  There is occasional, shifting, irregular theta and/or delta particularly in the temporal regions as well as a modest amount of generalized background theta.  Early in drowsiness, there is a prominent increase in background theta, as well as slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.   Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the background theta.  Photic stimulation elicits brief driving at intermediate flash frequencies.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess background theta.
Irregular theta and/or delta from the temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generalized theta may be due to the patientâ€™s medications.  In this individual with lifelong complex or simple partial seizures, correlation with imaging may be helpful regarding the irregular temporal theta and/or delta.
