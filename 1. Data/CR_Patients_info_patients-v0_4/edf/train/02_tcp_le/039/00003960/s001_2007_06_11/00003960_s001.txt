INTRODUCTION: 	Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 	In wakefulness, there is a 6-7Hz
60mV posterior dominant rhythm of amplitudes up to 50 microvolts. Features of drowsiness including anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and a little bit of hypersynchronous sign. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation does not elicit driving. Heart rate 96 beats per minute.
