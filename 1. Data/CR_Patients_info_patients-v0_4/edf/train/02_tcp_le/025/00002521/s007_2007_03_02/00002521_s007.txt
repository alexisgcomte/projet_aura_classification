CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 28-year-old woman with anoxic brain injury on 02/27/06 with prolonged ICU course and anoxic myoclonus, now living outside of the hospital.  This is her first EEG since April 2006. History of refractory status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, Phenobarbital, Ativan, and Baclofen.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient is in a wheelchair with a trache, but she appears clinically to be somnolent but she does open and close her eyes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE  RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow, but there does appear to be a posterior dominant rhythm.  The major features in this record are a generalized spike and slow wave complex with an unusual field of spread. It is approximately 2.7 to 3Hz, at this point picked up in the frontal and parietal regions.  Using a transverse montage, it seems to be maximum at the vertex.  Looking at the video, there doesn't seem to be a clinical correlate for these spikes.  The patient does seem to demonstrate a sleep state with vertex waves, but the 2.5 to
3 Hz vertex spike can be seen with and without this activity.  Photic stimulation is performed without an attempt to awaken the patient, however, there is  a questionable driving response.
Vigorous stimulation of the patient is not performed. HR:  84BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnom1al EEG due to:
1.   Persistence of a vertex and generalized spike and wave activity.
2.   Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: Given this patient's  history,  a repeat  testing  with adequate clinical testing is essential to make sure that maximal wakefulness and sleep states are captured.
