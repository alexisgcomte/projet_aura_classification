CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 56-year-old woman with epilepsy for 22 years.  Last seizure described as a black out in 2001.  Seizures occur every four to five years.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Depakote. Propranolol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 40 to 50 uV.  There is a MU rhythm, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  The background demonstrates a small amount of theta.  Head-rocking artifact is identified.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing some rhythmic background slowing.   Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing and vertex waves in stage I sleep.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm greater than would be expected for age.
Excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a previous study done on 9/29/05, this EEG demonstrates a bit more in terms of background slowing.  Medications may play a role in this pattern.
