CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year-old female with history of stroke with development of epilepsy some time in 2007, right parietal encephalomalacia. The patient presented with left focal twitching. These symptoms resolved following infusion of Depakote.
MEDICATIONS:   Depakote, Tegretol, Ativan
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient and clinical team feel that the patient's seizures have stopped prior to the placement of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overnight record is remarkable for the absence of seizures. Much of the record includes a sleep pattern with general beta activity. There is focal slowing in the right even if the patient reaches stage 2 sleep with spindle
activity. In addition, there is disruption of faster frequency on the right compared to the
left. By the next morning, the patient is awake. The left hemisphere demonstrates  a normal adult pattern with a well-defined reactive alpha rhythm. The right hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta and a handful of sharp waves including in the right frontotemporal/fronto-central region. As the recording continues, the focal slowing from the right hemisphere  gradually improves.
HR: 	N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
1. 	Highly irritative pattern with initial baseline electroencephalogram with repetitive epileptiform activity but without clinical seizures.
2. 	Dramatic improvement in terms of focal slowing and elimination of epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This baseline and long term EEG monitor are compatible with resolution of a complex partial status epilepticus.
