HISTORY: 42 year old male with end-stage HIV, multiple large lesions in the
left hemisphere with a smaller lesion in the right frontal region with a seizure today
followed by a profound change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Protonix, Lovenox, Pyrimethamine, Sulfasalazine.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is
poorly responsive. He has eye deviation or eye gaze preference to the left, does not
move the left side of the body, and is poorly interactive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes continuous periodic
high amplitude sharp waves in the right frontal region. There is initially more
involvement in the left frontal region. Tactile stimulation of the patient seems to
ameliorate some of the epileptiform activity and some it evolves into delta with tactile
stimulation. Frequent eye movements are noted. As the recording continues with
stimulation, there is an increasing beta.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly abnormal background.
2. High amplitude right frontal continuous periodic sharp waves in delta.
3. Some activity also involves the left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the clinical appearance, these findings are most
compatible with an ongoing epileptiform pattern. Additional EEG recording will be
obtained while the patient is receiving pharmacotherapy. In comparison to a previous
study two days ago, the right frontal periodic sharp waves were not identified.
