CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 65-year-old male with heart failure  Patient found with a left intracranial hemorrhage yesterday, now unresponsive and intubated.
MEDICATIONS: Mannitol, Digoxin, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized, low voltage, with a generous amount of muscle movement artifact superimposed on the background.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry with a left hemispheric slow activity of delta waves.  As the recording continues, starting from C3 evolving into the left central and left hemisphere with sharp activity, it becomes continuous with periodic sharp activity with slow waves lasting for more than up to one minute.  Two episodes are observed within this record.  After the episode, the focal slowing was observed in the left hemisphere. The patient was spontaneously moving his left leg, but no seizure behavior was observed on the video camera.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intrahemispheric asymmetry with a disorganized background.
Starting at C3 and evolving to the left hemisphere sharp and slow activity with two subclinical seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing with 2 electrographic seizures is diagnostic of a seizure disorder.  The seizures are in the region of the hemorrhage  This result was communicated with the primary team.
