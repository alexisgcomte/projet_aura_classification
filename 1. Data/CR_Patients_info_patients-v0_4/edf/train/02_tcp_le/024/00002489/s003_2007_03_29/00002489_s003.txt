CLINICAL   HISTORY:  This is a 14-year-old male with  severe MR, tuberculosis, epilepsy, right hemiatrophy, optic atrophy, and astrocytoma. This is the third EEG for this individual whose seizures occur as the patient awakens from  sleep.   The patient awakens with a startle. Previous EEG had technical difficulties.
MEDICATIONS: Topiramate, Levetiracetam, Carbamazepine, Diastat. INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG is performed in the lab with the patient in a
wheelchair using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient  is moving  about including making circular motions with his head throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow with primarily an arrhythmic theta pattern. There is occipitally predominant theta, particularly in the parasagittal regions.   The temporal regions are relatively featureless. There are bursts of rhythmic, higher amplitude delta with spread to the frontal regions and suspicious  posteriorly predominant sharp  waves in a background, which is quite problematic.
HR:  104 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Replacement of normal background with a slow pattern.
2.   A pattern in sleep without the typical morphologies of sleep, but with a pattern of theta and arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Epileptiform activity may be under-recognized in this individual due to the motion and other movement artifacts.  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.
