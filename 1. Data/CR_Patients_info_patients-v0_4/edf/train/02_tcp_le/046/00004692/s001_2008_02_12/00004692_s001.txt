CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year-old female, 39 weeks pregnant with a history of
complex partial seizures, headache, "blackout" and fell on the bus on February 11,
2008.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra., Prenatal vitamins
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 placement
of electrodes with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a very abnormal EEG with intrahemispheric
asymmetry with an alpha rhythm better defined on the left than the right. She has high
amplitude T2 sharp waves. There is also a predominance of temporal intermittent
rhythmic delta and theta activity which is present on both the left and the right. Photic
stimulation is performed with asymmetric paroxysmal driving. Hyperventilation is also
performed which activates the record. Characteristics of stage II drowsiness are seen
with vertex waves.
HR: 90 pm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frequent high amplitude sharp and slow wave activity bilaterally.
2. Independent episodes of temporal intermittent rhythmic delta and theta activity
bilaterally.
CLINICAL This very irritable EEG pattern suggests localized
pathology for epilepsy. These sharp and slow waves have been accentuated by the
recent seizure.
