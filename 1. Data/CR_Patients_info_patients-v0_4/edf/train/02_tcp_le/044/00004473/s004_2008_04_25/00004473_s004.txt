CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year-old male with bilateral occipital strokes, cortical
blindness, saphenous vein graft with 2 seizures in February 2008. Diabetes,
hypertension, coronary artery disease.
MEDICATIONS: Diovan, Ativan, Catapres
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is
an awake and asleep record.
Â·
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness there is an 8 hertz
posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of asymmetry rhythmic theta
activity in the right and a bit more destruction of faster frequency activities, as well as
slowing delta on the left. There is a question of some sharply contoured activity at T5,
but unfortunately there is also muscle artifact observed.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
2. Focal slowing from the left.
CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed in this record.
This EEG supports at least a mild, diffuse disturbance in cerebral function and possibly
a superimposed structural functional abnormality on the left.
