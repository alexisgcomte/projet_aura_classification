CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 10-year-old female with congenital hydrocephalus, seizures, a right posterior shunt now with a new type of seizure with generalized shaking lasting five to seven minutes.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol and Zyrtec.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is continuous, medium amplitude, primarily a theta frequency background with a hint of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In quiet wakefulness, there are sharp waves identified primarily from the right central region with variable maximum at C4/T4 or C4/P4.  There is a two-second burst of frontally predominant high amplitude 3 Hz spike and slow wave activity.  This activity is on the order of greater than 300 uV and is not associated with a discernable change in behavior.  In addition, as the child becomes slightly drowsy, additional bursts again less than 3 seconds with a frequency of 3 to 5 Hz are seen without clear clinical change.
HR:  108 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Right centrotemporal, central parietal spike and slow wave activity.
Intermittent brief bursts of generalized high amplitude spike and slow or poly spike and slow wave activity.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function and raises the possibility of more than one mechanism for seizures.
