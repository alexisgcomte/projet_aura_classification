CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old female with refractory status epilepticus following craniotomy for subdural hematoma.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This recording begins just after the patient has been treated on 6/28 for status epilepticus.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very irritative pattern with repetitive sharp waves and fast activity. While the initial EEG demonstrated prominent epileptiform activity in the frontal and temporal regions, the later long term monitor record, demonstrates epileptiform activity in the occipital temporal region. The record is intermittently discontinuous. The patient is somnolent.
Sustained bursts are not observed.

At 06:37 a.m., one epileptiform seizures occurred. This was maximum in the right posterior temporal region and are characterized by brief discharges definitive changes in clinical function. Seizure duration is 1 minute. By 11:18 a.m., electrode integrity is lost, and no additional seizures are noted.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittently suppressed pattern.
2. Prominent epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere, now transitioning to the posterior temporal region.
3. Single right posterior temporal seizure at 6:37 a.m.
