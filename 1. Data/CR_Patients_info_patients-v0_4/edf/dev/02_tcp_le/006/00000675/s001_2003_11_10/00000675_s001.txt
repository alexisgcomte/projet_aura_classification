CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 4-year-old female born at 30 weeks gestation by C-section because her mother had HELLP syndrome.  Developmental milestones and growth were normal according to the mother until two months ago when she was found to have staring spells and blanking-out lasting up to 30 seconds.  The mother also states that her daughter had a single episode of right-leg shaking during one of her spells.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is continuous, fairly well organized, and appropriate for age.   There is a 9 to 10 Hz, 75 to 100 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Soon after the recording began, a repetitive sharp wave activity was seen in the left hemisphere (F3/C3). As the recording continued, the child became drowsy with and then had a seizure.  On the EEG, it started from the left central area by sharp wave activity.  After 1½ seconds, it abruptly generalized with 3 Hz spike and wave activity.  This lasted for 40 seconds and stopped abruptly.  During the episode, the child was observed to be blinking her eyelids at the same rhythm of 3 Hz and stopped blinking when the EEG discharges stopped.
Nine seizures were recorded during this EEG tracing and 8 of 9 started in the left central region with sharp and wave activity one to two seconds before abrupt generalized 3 Hz.   One seizure seemed to be abrupt in onset in the right hemisphere and then immediately generalized to 3 Hz activity.  The generalized spike and wave  activity is 3-4 Hz  in the beginning and a little slower (less than 3) at the end of the seizure, with eye blinking as a clinical finding.
HR:  126 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 9 seizure, 8 of which emanate from the left hemisphere.
Left central sharp and slow activity.
3 Hz sharp/ slow wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG pattern is diagnostic of epilepsy.  The seizure type, based on the EEG findings, is more likely originating from the frontal region – an atypical absence seizure.  These EEG results were communicated to the pediatric neurology resident.
