CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 22-year-old woman with seizures who presents with increasing seizures, SPS in type associated with abdominal pain and bowel urgency.  Patient had 2 seizures today.
MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, there are bursts of irregular left temporal sharply contoured delta. There is an alpha rhythm of about 9 Hz. but excessive background slowing, which is poorly organized.  Hyperventilation is performed when the patient is drowsy produces increased 3 to 4 Hz activity, left more than right.  It is frontally predominant.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Sharply contoured delta seen in hyperventilation and drowsiness with occasional left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is supportive of a diffuse cerebral dysfunction possibly due to postictal.  Video EEG is recommended.
