CLINICAL HISTORY: 59-year-old male with epilepsy, last seizure 3 weeks ago, with postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. There is no hyperventilation. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG is appropriately organized for an adult of this age with a low voltage 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized
by an increase in background theta present bilaterally. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Single channel artifact is picked up at F7. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 	90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform  features were observed in this record. Previous EEGs demonstrates left temporal sharps but none were seen today
