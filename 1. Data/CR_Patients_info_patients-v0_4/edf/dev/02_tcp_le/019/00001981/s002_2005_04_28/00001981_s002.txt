CLINICAL HISTORY: This  is  a 56-year-old male with  a seizure  disorder.   His last seizure was one month ago with tonic-clonic  activity with postictal confusion.   This is a follow-up study.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video  EEG is performed  in the  lab using  standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation  and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION  OF   THE   RECORD:  In  wakefulness,   the  background   EEG  is symmetric  and fairly  well  organized  for  his age.   There  is  a 9  Hz,  30  uV  posterior dominant alpha rhythm, which is attenuated of low  voltage, frontocentral  beta  activity.   As the tracing continues, spike and sharp waves,  with and without slow activity, is seen at the F7 and T1 regions.   These  focal discharges  increased with hyperventilation  and also were seen in post-hyperventilation. They were occasionally  seen in photic stimulation.   Sleep  is evidenced by slow  rolling eye movements,  a mixed frequency of brain activity, vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.   Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR:  72BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Spike and sharp with slow wave activity in the left anterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal findings in this abnormal EEG are suggestive of an underlying pathological  process and provide a localization-related  mechanism  for epilepsy in this patient.
