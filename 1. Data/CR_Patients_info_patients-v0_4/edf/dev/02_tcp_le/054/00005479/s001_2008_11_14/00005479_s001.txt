CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed woman with sudden change in mental status. Patient had a Ionic, clonic seizure after severe headache and i s being evaluated for meningitis. Past history of hypertension, lupus, aneurysm clip, shunt with a craniotomy with absence of a bone flap at present. The patient had a seizure during the EEG electrode placement. Patient was able to follow commands, but speech. was nonsensical.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Prednisone. Gabapentin, Zelia (?), Lovastatin, Metformin, Lisinopril, HCTZ, Plaquenil
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic Stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins. the patient is postictal. The initial background EEG is slow, low voltage. There is a breech rhythm, but there is arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere particularly frontocentral temporal region with sharp waves in the left frontal and left temporal region. As the tracing continues, Increasing wakefulness Is seen with alpha and theta frequency activity at times, 9 hertz alpha activity in the right hemisphere. Even in wakefulness, left frontal delta is observed with occasional left frontal sharp waves. This EEG is recorded in 2 pieces. The 1st section showed limited photic stimulation with out a driving response. The 2nd section demonstrates a drowsy pattern with ongoing, focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region and sharp waves.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the. left persistent throughout the record, but improving over time.
2. Left frontal and frontotemporal sharp waves.
3. Initially generalized background slowing improving over the course of the record with significant improvement In the background on the right.
CLINICAL The improving pattern is compatible with a postictal state. The irregular delta in the left frontal and temporal region is compatible with a structural abnormality on the left as well and underlying epileptic disorder.
