History:	29 yo p/w myoclonic status epilepticus and hx of mitochondrial disorder; pneumonia
aspiration; resp failure; hypoxia; high blood pressure. pmhx: Dementia, HTN, SZ
pshx: stab wound to abdomen, vagal nerve stim.
Medications:	Vimpat, Ativan (8mg) , Versed, Ceftriaxone, Clindamycin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There
is intermixed beta while awake. With sleep the background appears to become more intermittently
suppressed and with a more predominant diffuse delta slowing.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent bifrontal and central maximal polyspikes that have a large
field. These at times lasr for about a second and are followed by a more prominent diffuse slowing.
There is also about 20 seizures per hour during the majority of the record. Seizures stopped after
10 PM.  Seizure on EEG: Sudden diffuse beta followed by attenuation and then muscle artifact
with sudden stop. This is followed by frontal predominant rhythmic delta for about 3 seconds. This
last from 5 to 15 seconds.  Clinically the patient flexes his neck and lift both arms in a bicycle
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 120
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, frequent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  status epilepticus with generalized seizures that improved
in the last hours. In addition there is severe  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
