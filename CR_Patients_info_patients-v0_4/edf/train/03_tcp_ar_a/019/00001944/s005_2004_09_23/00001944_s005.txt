INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There is a prolonged patient push button in the early morning hours and it looks as if the button got stuck, but no definite ictal changes were seen.   All push buttons identifiable in the computer appear to be either practice or accidental push buttons.
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness the background EEG continues to show a breach rhythm with high amplitude alpha frequency activity from the right central and temporal regions.  Focal slowing is seen with occasional sharply contoured wicket.
HR:  Resting heart rate up to 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:   ** TO BE FILLED IN**
