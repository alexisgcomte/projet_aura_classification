CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 23-year-old male with a history of seizures in 2003 associated with cocaine use, now admitted with a fall and a seizure prior to the fall.
MEDICATIONS: Morphine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is wearing a hard collar.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9.5 Hz, 30 uV posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the EEG with rhythmic background slowing. Brief stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
There is high amplitude eye movement artifact, some of which is notched.
HR:  50 to 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with two normal EEGs and at least two seizures, although one associated with cocaine abuse, additional recording in the lab following removal of the hard collar is recommended with generous hyperventilation and photic stimulation to be certain that there is no underlying spike and wave activity.
