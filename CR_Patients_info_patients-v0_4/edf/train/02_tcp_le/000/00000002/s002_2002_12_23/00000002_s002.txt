CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old, right-handed woman with CNS vasculitis with focal complex partial status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: PB, VPA, others
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent.  During the course of the recording, the patient is intubated for seizures at approximately 17:45.  She also receives IV Valproate in order to control the seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This section of the record begins on the afternoon of 12/23 and concludes at 19:47 on 12/24.  During this portion of the record, the patient has frequent seizures, which are similar in pattern to that seen on the earlier study performed the same day with repetitive, faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere, followed by gradual evolution over a 20 second period to repetitive theta frequency activity and then evolution to repetitive spike and slow wave activity.  Average seizure duration demonstrates some change, initially on the order of one to three minutes.  Over time, this changes to three to five minutes.  Every hour of the record demonstrates seizures.  Duration of seizure free periods range from 3-6 minutes. At the close of the record, on the morning of the 24th, the patient experiences complex partial seizures.  There are no notes made regarding the patientâ€™s medications.
