CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old woman with subdural hematoma seen with seizure of left
arm shaking.
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Lorazepam, Codeine, Theragran, Acetaminophen, Zofran
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE As the record begins a slow background is seen in the
theta delta range. There is a bit of an interhemispheric asymmetry with slower rhythm seen in
the left hemisphere with loss of faster frequencies. As the record continues on the video,
increasing abdominal motions are seen of the patient. This activity on the video is seen just at
the start of left frontotemporal sharp waves which are slow. The first episode lasts for
approximately 5 minutes of the video. The patient on video appears to be tachypneic as the
sharp waves continue and evolve. A second seizure is caught. During this time there is a major
evolution of the episode and lasts under a minute and slowly resolved. Again the patient is seen
to be tachypneic but ends abruptly. As the record draws to a close a third episode is seen again
of these slow sharp waves in the frontotemporal region, at this time with more evolution lasting
about a minute and 40 seconds.
HR: 96 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Three recorded seizures.
2. Slowing of the background with greater slowing on the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Three seizures were recorded, and the clinical neurosurgical team
was immediately contacted, and a plan for long-term monitoring was put into place along with
treatment discussion.
