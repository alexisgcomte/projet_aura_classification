CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old male admitted with recurrent seizures over the past 3 weeks characterized by headache,  chest pain, dizziness. Multiple seizures this morning treated with Ativan. Past history of MVA with loss of consciousness 10 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
During this EEG the patient had a seizure. This was at 10-9-06 2006. He is lying comfortably with  a normal awake pattern. This is followed by jerking, hiccupping, and head moving from side to side. Asynchronous arm movements are noted, a little bit more so on the left arm. He turns
his head to the left, and he bounces back and forth. During the seizure a well-defined alpha
rhythm can be identified. As he rocks his head to the left, artifact is picked up on some of the scalp electrodes, but the alpha rhythm can still be seen despite the fact that he is moving about. The behavior after 43 seconds and the EEG demonstrates a normal pattern. Of note, he starts rocking his head to the right and looks to the left at the end of the event. The technologist calls the patient. He is unresponsive despite a normal awake EEG. Another event occurs at 10:10:09. He receives Ativan for the second behavior, which is not sustained. The resident comes in and examines the patient. The patient makes eye contact with the resident during the examination. By the close of the EEG he remains awake but appears more comfortable.
HR:	54-96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The 2 behaviors observed were not associated with epileptiform activity. In addition, they had behavioral characteristics of a nonepileptic seizure.
