CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 3.4-year-old male with three tonic-clonic seizures in May treated at Einstein and two tonic-clonic seizures occurring as the child drifted off to sleep yesterday.  Family history of epilepsy – no other known epilepsy risk factors.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital (started 6/16/03).
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is uncooperative.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a child of this age with a posterior dominant rhythm of 6 Hz, reaching amplitudes up to 75 V. As the child becomes drowsy, there is rhythmic background slowing with 4 Hz posteriorly predominant theta.  The overall drowsy pattern is appropriately symmetric for age.
As the patient reaches stage I sleep with vertex waves, there are a handful of sharp waves identified in the record.  These may be maximum in the right central or centrotemporal region.  There is a single one from the left central region, one from the left temporal region, and another that is more rare from the left centrotemporal region. This is also identified on rare occasions from the right mid-to-centrotemporal regions.  These can be seen as the child drifts from stage I to stage II sleep with symmetric, well-formed vertex waves and spindles.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a child of this age due to:
Centrotemporal sharp waves including one or two that are frontocentral in sleep identified from either hemisphere, all of which are independent in one hemisphere or the other.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a partial or localization mechanism for this child’s epilepsy.  Consideration for a benign Rolandic syndrome is recommended. This record is in contrast to a previous record done in May 2003 at Einstein, which was a normal study although it is not known if sleep was recorded.
