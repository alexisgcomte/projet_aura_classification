DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern on the right, but the left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta, rhythmic temporal slowing, left central temporal sharp waves, and intermittent, repetitive, bursts of sharp waves from the left with a generous field of spread, including central temporal, frontal, and posterior temporal regions. These demonstrate frequency evolution, but are not associated with a definitive change in the patient's mental status.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
