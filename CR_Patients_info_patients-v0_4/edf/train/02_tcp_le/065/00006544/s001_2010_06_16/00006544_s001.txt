CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old male status post code 06/14 for 10-15 minutes, now with myoclonic movements, DNR1, small cell lung cancer, DVT, VDRF, diabetes.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Insulin, Protonix, Zosyn, Thiamine, Morphine, Depakote, Zofran, Vanco, Prednisone, Percocet

INTRODUCTION; Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. There is myoclonic activity with a high amplitude generalized poly spike activity. The activity is relatively symmetric and is posteriorly predominant. When it abates, there seems to be a focus of right delta. The epileptiform activity is associated with jerking of the chin and chest. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record. The background is variable and consists of either a very suppressed pattern or a pattern with some 8 hertz alpha frequency activity which is probably part of the patient's ictal pattern.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. A form of myoclonic status epilepticus with focal jerking which demonstrates frequency evolution.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are poor prognostic findings following cardiac arrest. The findings were discussed with the team
