CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old male with multiple skull defects and severe  intellectual dysfunction, hydrocephalus, seizures, and multiple  shunt revisions. Patient admitted in status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is low voltage and featureless.   The overall background is continuous, rich in beta frequency activity. There is some arrhythmic delta activity and there is a slight prominence of theta frequency activity in the frontal regions.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in background beta. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta. As the recording continues, the background is richer in theta frequency activity.
HR:  112BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1.     Replacement of normal background with a low voltage pattern with generous fast activity.
2.   Excess background theta.
3.   Shifting arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with recent status epilepticus, there are no epileptiform features identified in this record.   There is generous background beta
raising the possibility that the patient might have had benzodiazepines.  It is important to know the duration of time since this patient's  status epilepticus to put the background slowing described above in the appropriate clinical context.
