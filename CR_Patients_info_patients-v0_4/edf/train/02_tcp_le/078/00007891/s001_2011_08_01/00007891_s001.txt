HISTORY:
A 79-year-old woman with a change in mental status and multiple seizures in the elevator today.
PAST HISTORY:
Uterine cancer, stroke, right hemiparesis, anemia, and many medical problems. Cerebral atrophy. DNR 1
MEDICATIONS:
Percocet, Ativan, Versed, and others.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 1 0/20 system of electrode placement The patient is
intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The activity from the left is somewhat slow with a mixture of theta
frequencies. The right hemisphere demonstrates a high amplitude right frontal spike and polyspike complex, which is
somewhat periodic in nature. Waxes and wanes. As the recording continues, eye blinking artifacts were noted that
appeared to correlate with the right frontal sharp and slow-wave and periodic complexes. Despite this, and during this,
stimulation of the patient clearly produced an alerting with an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity on the left.
At 11 :02 Ativan was given. There is a transient decrease in faster activity in the EEG, but by the end of the record, the
patient seemed to be more arousal again with faster frequency activity on the left and a periodic complexes in the right
frontal region.
Heart rate 144 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A high amplitude periodic complex in the right frontal region.
2. Background slowing more prominent on the right than the left.
3. What appeared to be clinically, simple partial seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The Ativan did reduce the epileptiform activity, but the effect was short lasting and in fact, the patient seemed to be
relatively responsive by the end of the EEG.
