HISTORY:
A 47-year-old woman found in a drug house with seizure-like activity. Abnormal MRI suggesting encephalitis but no cells in
CSF
ROOM NUMBER:
Emergency room.
MEDICATIONS:
Ativan 8 mg.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the emergency room using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement
with one channel of EKG. The patient is examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The background EEG begins With a marked asymmetry between the two hemispheres. It is very low-voltage suppressed
with a paucity of beta activity on the left. In contrast, the right includes generous beta, diffusely. In this relatively
low-voltage pattern on the left, there are subtle, periodic sharp waves or sharply contoured delta at C3-P3. As the
recording continues, the patient is starting to move about, there is additional beta activity noted from both hemispheres.
The periodic complexes are still apparent underneath the muscle and movement artifact. Stimulation of the patient
produces an increase in muscle artifact. As the recording continues, the epileptiform activity transitions to a bit more of a
frontotemporal broadly contoured discharge with a broad field of spread.
Heart rate 104 BPM.

IMPRESSION:
Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.
Initially, a markedly slow and suppressed pattern on the left.
2.
An asymmetry that persists throughout the record with a much slower pattern on the left.
3.
A periodic complex seen intermittently from the left. The patient was a bit more agitated by the end of the record, but
on the video, no jerking can be discerned during the video to correlate with the periodic complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
In this individual with recent seizures characterized by right-sided jerking, the periodic complexes and focal slowing should
be correlated with imaging to exclude a structural pathology. No prolonged seizures were recorded.
