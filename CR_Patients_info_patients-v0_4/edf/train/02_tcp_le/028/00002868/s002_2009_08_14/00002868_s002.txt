CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient presents with a history of cirrhosis, GI bleeding, esophagus varices, hepatic encephalopathy.

MEDICATIONS: Ceftriaxone and others.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was not performed. The patient is intubated and unresponsive.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: At the beginning of the study of the EEG, the background of EEG is significantly disorganized. The normal posterior alpha rhythm cannot be recognized. Instead superimposed of slow activity in sometimes theta with significant triphasic, spike and slow activity was seen throughout the tracing. Stimulation of the patient did not cause a significant background change.

Heart rate: 114 BPM.

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
1. Significant disorganized background.
2. Absence of alpha rhythm.
3. Significant background slowing with triphasic sharp and slow activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The finding of this reading indicates a significant cerebral dysfunction involving in the gray matter and subcortical white matter typically seen in metabolic encephalopathy such as hepatic encephalopathy as well as the other mechanisms. The prognosis in this patient is guarded and a clinical correlation is recommended. No seizure activity was seen in this tracing.
