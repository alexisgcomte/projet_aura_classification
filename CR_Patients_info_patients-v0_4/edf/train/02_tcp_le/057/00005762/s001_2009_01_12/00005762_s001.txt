CLINICAL HISTORY: A25 year old male with a single seizure related to antihistamine use at age 8. Patient reports a seizure in November 2008 while taking antibiotics, Propecia, and antifungal and playing the guitar. No aura. Tonic-clonic  activity. Former premature infant with past ill-defined prenatal history.
MEDICATIONS: Propecia, Fluconazole.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed   in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, there is a 10.8 Hz alpha rhythm of
50 to 70 meg with prominent eye movement artifact such as lateral rectus artifact. In addition, there is mu activity and temporal wicket. In hyperventilation and in a handful of occasions there is a suggestion of an underlying sharp wave in the left temporal region. Unfortunately this is the same area as remarkable for significant eye movement artifact and wicket, and some of the activity described above is clearly wicket. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic simulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are multiple sharply contoured normal variants or artifacts including wicket and eye artifact. No definitive epileptiform features are observed. A repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is advised.
