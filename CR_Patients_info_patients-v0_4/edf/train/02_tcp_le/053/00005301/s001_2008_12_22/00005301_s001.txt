CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old gentleman with a history of massive left MCA CVAs 9 years
ago with epilepsy. Typically 1-2 seizures per year. Now with increasing obtundation. Typical
seizures characterized by lip smacking and right leg movement. Evaluate for change In mental
status.
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Lisinopril, Catapres, Simvastatin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10.20 system of
electrode placement 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record in an obtunded
individual.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background or this EEG is diffusely slow with a slow
pattern bilaterally. The overall pattern is low voltage and from the left hemisphere there is .
disruption of fast or frequency activity. Independent, well-defined sharp waves are identified on
either hemisphere on the left T1, TS, 57, on the right, right mid to anterior temporal region. As
the re cording continues, with stimulation the background includes additional theta frequency
activity. There are 1 or 2 discharges which demonstrate secondary spread from the right to the
left. Features of sleep Including vertex waves. Stimulation of the patient occurs when the
patient is a little bit more awake and the overall pattern Is more of theta pattern.
HR: 96 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the left with disruption of fast or frequency activity.
3. Sharp waves from the left hemisphere including anterior temporal and posterior temporal
as anticipated.
4. High amplitude right temporal spike and slow wave complexes.

CLINICAL CORRELATION The focal features on the left as well as the sharp waves are
Anticipated given the magnitude of this individual infarct. The generalized. background slowing
supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as one might anticipate with
hyperammonemia. The sharp waves on the right are an unanticipated finding.
