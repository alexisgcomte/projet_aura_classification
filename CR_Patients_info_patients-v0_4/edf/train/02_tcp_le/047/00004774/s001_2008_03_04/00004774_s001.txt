INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized with 10.5 hertz, 30-50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Features of drowsiness include slow-rolling eye movements.
HR: 	74-96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were seen. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, repeat study is advised.
