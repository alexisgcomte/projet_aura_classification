CLINICAL HISTORY:   65 yea -old right handed male with 40-year history of epilepsy. Seizures occur every 5 months, but last seizure was 2 months ago. Tonic-clonic seizures occur in sleep.
MEDICATIONS:  Vicodin, Coreg, Digoxin, Keppra, Prednisone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photo stimulation was concluded. This is an awake through stage 2 sleep record.
DESCRIPTION  OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG includes a well organized, low voltage pattern with a 10 hertz posterior dominant rhythm, 30-40 UV/mm posterior dominant rhythm. There are some normal variants observed in this record including rhythmic central theta of drowsiness and some temporal theta, but there is
also some subtle, left temporal theta which, on 1 or 2 occasions is somewhat irregular and somewhat sharply contoured. Photic stimulation is performed when the patient is drifting in and out of sleep, but does activate the record.
HR:	66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Subtle left temporal focal slowing with left temporal slightly irregular theta.
CLINICAL CORR  ELATION:   In an adult of this age, this can be seen in underlying ischemic cerebrovascular disease, but it is also seen in localization related epilepsy. No definitive sharp waves are observed today.
