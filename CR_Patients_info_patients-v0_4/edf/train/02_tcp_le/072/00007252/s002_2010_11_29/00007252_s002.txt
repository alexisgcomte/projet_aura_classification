INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel EKG. The patient was intubated and poorly responsive. He has occasional motor jerking.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG includes a theta frequency pattern, superimposed upon this are generalized periodic complexes, maximum in the posterior regions. On some occasions, the patient has twitching and blinking. There are focal sharp waves noted. Ativan nearly eliminates the sharp waves and the EEG returns to a primarily theta frequency pattern.
HR: 104 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Status epilepticus characterized by generalized, posterior predominant complexes with facial twitching and blinking which is responsive to benzodiazepine.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Identical features were seen last week.
