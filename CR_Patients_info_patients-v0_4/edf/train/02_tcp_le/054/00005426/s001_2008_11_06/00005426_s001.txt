CLINICAL HISTORY: 	59 year old with cranioplasty, stroke in 1993, now with an episode of unresponsiveness 1 hour prior to this EEG.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel of EKG. This is an awake study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is compromised primarily of diffuse rhythmic 5-6 Hz theta activity with smaller amounts of frontal central theta. Features of sleep include: The patient is awake.  He has a cortical posture of his left hand and he has a persistent automatisms in the right hand without EEG correlate.
HR: 	90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Replacement of normal background with diffuse rhythmic theta
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   In this individual with a past craniotomy there is a bit of an amplitude asymmetry compatible with a breech,  but there is no epileptiform features. The background component is most compatible with diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. In comparison to a previous EEG on August 28, 2008.  Today there was no continuous right sided slowing, no sharp  waves in the right central parietal region.  The previous studies were compatible with subclinical status epilepticus, not seen today.
