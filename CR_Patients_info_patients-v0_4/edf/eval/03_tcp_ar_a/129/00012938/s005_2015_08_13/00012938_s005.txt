Medications:	KEPPRA, INSULIN, METOPROLOL, MIDAZOLAM, DILANTIN

Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 26 hours from 08/12/2015 to 08/13/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

None
Description:
There is right-to-left asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The background over the right
consists of polymorphic poorly modulated 7-8 Hz theta activity posteriorly, excess polymorphic theta
and delta activity and poor AP gradient.  The background over the left lacks PDR and AP gradient.
The background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with
delta activity most pronounced posteriorly.  Additionally, frequent, left posterior quadrant spikes and
polyspikes are captured.  At times they become rhythmic, with a repetition rate of ~ 1 Hz (example,
~10:23 am).  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over T5, P3 and O1 leads.  Sleep spindles and K-
complexes are captured.
Multiple electrographic seizure are recorded beginning with rhythmic in the O1 region. They
commence with rhythmic PLEDs plus at 1Hz and evolving into 3Hz activity as well as an increase in
amplitude.  The discharges remain in the left occipital region with minimal spread. Seizure last
from 1 to 4 minutes.  There was no clinical correlate associated to this EEG activity documented on
video.  The seizures stopped after about 10 hours of recording. PLEDs could still be seen in the
region but only intermittently with no evolution. However this discharges appear to have a larger
During the last 10 hours only intermittent sharp waves in the posterior quadrant were seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 108

Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal awake and asleep hour portable EEG due to (1) electrographic status anterior field over the left hemisphere.
