CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 23-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy since childhood status-post vagus nerve stimulator and left frontotemporal craniotomy.  Patient with head injury at age five, subsequent seizures, and brain surgery at age nine. Seizure-free for years.  Typical seizures described as right-sided numbness and shaking with twitching and loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Carbatrol, Klonopin, and the vagus stimulator.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. A prominent skull defect is identified.  Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record demonstrates a relatively well organized background particularly in view of the patientâ€™s craniotomy. There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm of 30 to 70 uV with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is occasional rhythmic or arrhythmic slowing seen in different regions including the left central parietal region and occasionally bilaterally in the posterior regions.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is additional rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits a limited driving response, but certainly a driving response is present.
Overall, in this area with some evidence of shifting slowing, the area that stands out is the left central parietal region, and there seems to be an underlying sharp wave in early drowsiness and deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle shifting slowing, often posteriorly predominant.
Subtle underlying left central parietal slowing with a suspicious sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a bihemispheric process as well as producing some evidence for a structural or functional abnormality in the left central parietal region. Of note, this location is posterior to the previous surgery.  No definite sharp waves were seen.  A follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep would be helpful to further delineate epileptiform activity.
