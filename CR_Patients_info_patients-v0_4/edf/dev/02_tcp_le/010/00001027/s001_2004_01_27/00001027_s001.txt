CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 50-year-old male with previous surgery for a left frontal glioma now with accelerating complex partial seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has multiple events, some of which are identified by the family and some of which are subclinical.
FIRST EVENT, TIME 17:10 to 17:12:43:  The patient is sleeping. He extends his right arm.  His daughter observes the seizure and rushes to press the alarm button.  The patient is partially under the covers and other motor features are not identifiable.  Testing determines that he is not responsive at 17:11:43. The EEG is partially obscured by muscle and movement, but there is the appearance of rhythmic, paroxysmal, sharply contoured beta activity in the background.
SECOND EVENT, TIME 19:28:48:  The patient is sleeping.  Again, the precise scalp correlates are partly obscured by muscle and movement as the patient is moving under the covers.  Clear paroxysmal frequency evolution with rhythmic, sharply contoured 4 Hz activity maximum in the frontocentral regions is identified.  The seizure ends at 19:31:32.
THIRD EVENT, TIME 21:31:42: The patient is awake, talking to a nurse.  He elevates his arm and becomes poorly responsive.  This EEG demonstrates more alpha frequency activity, which comes from the right frontocentral region.  He has psychomotor slowing and by 21:31:58 he has right arm extension and right gaze deviation.  The EEG activity is maximum in the right frontocentral region with alpha frequency activity and by 21:32:14, the repetitive, slower sharp and slow wave frequencies can be seen particularly in the midline and right frontocentral region.  The nurse starts to speak to the patient at 21:32:28 and she has been doing activities at the bedside which caused her to look away from the patient rather than at the patient and as the recording continues, she begins to realize that the patient is having a seizure at 21:32:44 when she pushes the alarm bell.  The seizure ends at 21:34:13, as the frequency evolution slows.  The EEG activity continues to slow with slow spike and wave activity, which is maximum in the frontal regions although generalized towards the close of the seizure.
SERIES OF PUSH BUTTON EVENTS  9? :37: The patient is drowsy in the room.  No clinical seizures are seen. He seems to be falling asleep holding the seizure alarm.  Check  for exact time
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The background EEG demonstrates rhythmic background theta in wakefulness with focal slowing and sharply contoured activity from the right frontocentral regions.
Long-Term Monitoring, 1/28/04 to 1/29/04
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the EEG monitoring unit. Subtle seizures are identified as well as subclinical seizures.  During this portion of the record, the patient receives Phenobarbital and Phenytoin.
FIRST SEIZURE EVENT 10:31:06: The patient is resting comfortably in the bed with the lights off.  The background demonstrates a focal slowing from the right frontocentral region.  The first change is probably at 10:31:06 with some arrhythmic slowing followed by high amplitude faster frequency activity.  While there seems to be some muscle, there is clearly alpha frequency activity for approximately 15 seconds in the frontal regions, left greater than right, and then frequency evolution.  In this event, the patient has no motor signs, and he has no eye movement until 10:31:51.  The seizure is clearly over with a previous baseline seen at 10:33:16.
SECOND SEIZURE EVENT 10:56:45: The patient is alone in his room.  No clinical signs are seen, but there is alpha frequency activity, as well as muscle.  The alpha frequency activity is picked up in the left frontocentral region but is seen bilaterally.  This activity continues to evolve with faster frequency activity from the right frontocentral region as well as rhythmic slowing seen in the posterior region and some asymmetry, faster on the left than the right.  By 10:57:27, high amplitude spike and slow wave activity can be seen despite the muscle and movement artifact from the right frontal region.  At 10:57:36, the patient lifts the left hand in a somewhat automatic fashion. By 10:57:45, he looks to the right.  The activity continues to evolve, maximum in the left hemisphere and the frontocentral regions with a generous field of spread, but there is clear slowing from the right hemisphere.  The arm elevates at 10:58:05.  When the team comes to test the patient, a few minutes later, the patient is initially postictal.  He is tested at 10:59:15 when he is slow to arouse, but then answers questions appropriately.  By the time the physicians walk in to test the patient, the seizure is over.  The physicians walk in just in the last five seconds of the seizure.  Within 20 seconds or so his responsiveness improves.
SLEEP TIME, 5:40 AM: The seizures slow down.  By 5:40 AM, the EEG shows a pattern with generous beta frequency activity.  A seizure occurs out of sleep at 5:51:41 with little in the way of clinical signs.  There is high amplitude frequency evolution with the characteristic pattern of theta and alpha frequency activity and then slowing.  The seizures ends at 5:41:31.  The seizure emanates from stage II sleep and afterwards the patient has a brief arousal and then goes back to sleep. Features of sleep include the beta activity, focal slowing, and occasional sharp waves, as well as a breach from the left frontal region.
SEIZURE, TIME 04:29:28: The patient is asleep.  He is leaning on his right side.  At 4:29:19, as the EEG begins to show rhythmic alpha and theta frequency activity maximum from the left central region, but with some generalization, the patient lifts his fingers up and extends them. He had been asleep and the activity might appear as some form of a purposeful automatism.  The alarm bell is heard to be rung at 4:29:39.  The EEG shows rhythmic theta frequency evolution. The rhythmic theta frequency activity continues at 4:30:34 with characteristic frequency evolution, faster frequency activity persisting in the frontal regions on the left, and begins to slow in the other regions of the brain.  This seizure has a similar pattern to other seizures in that the paroxysmal activity wanes, but there remains some fast activity in the right frontal region at 4:31:58, which gradually abates.  The EEG seems to have returned to the background at 04:33.
