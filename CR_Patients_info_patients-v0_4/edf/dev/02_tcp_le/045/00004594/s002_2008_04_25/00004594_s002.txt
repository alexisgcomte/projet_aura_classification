CLINICAL HISTORY: 59year-old nonverbal woman with recent prolonged
hospitalization for interventricular hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage, now with
a trach and feeding tube. Evaluate for declining mental status; however, she has
improving right intracerebral hemorrhage and left hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, Nexium, Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Insulin, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with one channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates some
interhemispheric asymmetry. The left hemisphere is better organized than the right.
Both hemispheres demonstrate theta frequency activity but there is more disruption of
faster frequency activity observed from the right in comparison to the left. Frequent eye
blink artifact is observed. At times an 8Hz alpha rhythm can be identified, left more so
than right. Occasional frontal delta is observed. Photic stimulation elicits a driving
response more so on the left than the right with photo electric artifact.
HR: 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1 . Focal slowing on the right with disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Mild background slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform seizures were observed in this record.
This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right involving gray and white matter.
