CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year-old woman who was transferred
after a right intracerebral hemorrhage which was evacuated. She remains
unresponsive. History of substance abuse, asthma, COPD. The date of this patient's
CNS injury and surgery are not provided.
MEDICATIONS: Ceftriaxone, Labetalol, Nexium, Metoprolol, Vancomycin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The video is not functional
throughout much of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a markedly slow,
relatively featureless pattern. The activity can be reviewed at a sensitivity of 3 or 5 at
which point a low voltage, slow featureless pattern with scant quantities of beta
frequency activity are observed. The beta frequency activity is best seen in the posterior
parietal regions as well as right frontal and a little left parietal. There is waxing and
waning with some slow delta and a small amount of rhythmic delta. Stimulation of the
patient also appears to produce some beta and some faster frequency activity.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The low voltage,
relatively featureless pattern, is remarkable for some reactivity and some beta. The beta
suggests that the patient may have been exposed to benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
